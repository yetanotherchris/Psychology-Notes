## Apologies
Narcissists may use a range of insincere apology tactics, including:

- Minimizing: "It wasn't a big deal; why are you so upset?"
- Conditional Apology: "I’m sorry _if_ I upset you" (implying it’s your sensitivity at fault).
- Blame-Shifting: "I’m sorry, but you made me do it."
- Self-Victimizing: "I’m sorry I’m such a terrible person; I can’t do anything right."
- Deflecting: "Let’s just move on; why dwell on the past?"
- Guilt-Tripping: "I said I’m sorry. What else do you want from me?"
- Superficial: A quick "I’m sorry" without follow-up actions to address the issue or change the behavior.

These types of apologies lack accountability or a sincere effort to repair the relationship.
