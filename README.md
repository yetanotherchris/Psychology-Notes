# Psychology notes

This site contains all my notes relating to a Psychology and a Psychology degree. Where possible I will reference the source of the notes, 
which are typically books and Youtube videos, as Youtube is a goldmine for Pyschology education, both good and bad.

These are my personal psychology notes, written in my own words or re-written by an LLM (this should be clear  when this is the case). 
Any brief quotes are for study purposes and credited to their sources.

### Questionnaires & Inventories
The questions and choices for these questionnaires have been generated by a LLM, based on public material or the model itself, with exception to the FQ. 
I ask the LLM for its sources when I do this, and when there's questions of copyright, I don't continue - which fortunately is rare.
