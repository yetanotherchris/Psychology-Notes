Means and Standard Deviations
Since this is a 5-point Likert adaptation, exact norms arenâ€™t as standardized as the original forced-choice NPI-40. However, I can extrapolate from research on the original NPI and Likert adaptations:

Original NPI-40 (Forced-Choice):
Mean: Around 15-17 (out of 40) in non-clinical samples (e.g., college students).
Standard Deviation: Around 6-7.
Source: Raskin & Terry (1988) reported a mean of 15.55 (SD = 6.66) in a sample of 1,018 undergraduates.
Likert-Scale Adaptations:
For a 5-point scale (40-200 range), means and SDs depend on the sample. Research using Likert versions (e.g., Ackerman et al., 2011, or similar studies) often rescale to match the original, but raw scores can be estimated:
General Population Mean: Approx. 90-110 (mid-range, reflecting moderate narcissism).
Standard Deviation: Approx. 20-30.
Example: A study by Miller et al. (2016) using a 5-point Likert NPI reported subscale means, which, when summed, suggest a total mean around 100-120 in non-clinical adults, with SDs around 25.
Interpretation:
Below 80: Low narcissism.
80-120: Average narcissism (most people fall here).
Above 140: High narcissism (potentially subclinical or clinical levels).

Authority (e.g., NPI_05, NPI_07, NPI_10): 8 items.
Self-Sufficiency (e.g., NPI_30, NPI_33): 6 items.
Superiority (e.g., NPI_36): 5 items.
Exhibitionism (e.g., NPI_03, NPI_17): 7 items.
Exploitativeness (e.g., NPI_12): 5 items.
Vanity (e.g., NPI_18): 3 items.
Entitlement (e.g., NPI_14, NPI_24): 6 items.
