These are questionnaires and inventories, tured into [surveyjs](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/get-started-html-css-javascript) compatible JSON and HTML surveys.

- They should all be accessible with easy to use UIs.
- I'm hoping to take some https://github.com/haghish/openpsychometrics and others and import them.
- The data in this folder is for educational purposes only, not for commercial use, based on fair use principles.
