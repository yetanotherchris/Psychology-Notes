These are questionnaires and inventories, with the questions slightly adjusted by Chat GPT, and turned in [JSPysch](https://github.com/jspsych/) based HTML pages.

They should all be accessible with easy to use UIs.
I'm hoping to take some https://github.com/haghish/openpsychometrics and others and import them.

The data in this folder is for educational purposes only, not for commercial use, based on fair use principles.

They're work in progress.
