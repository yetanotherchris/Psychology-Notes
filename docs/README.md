# Psychology notes

This site contains all my notes relating to Psychology and Psychology degree I'm studying. Where possible I will reference the source of the notes, 
which are typically papers and books but can be Youtube videos, as Youtube is a goldmine for (non-academic) Pyschology education, both good and bad.

These are my personal psychology notes, written in my own words or re-written by an LLM (this should be clear  when this is the case). 
Any brief quotes are for study purposes and credited to their sources.
