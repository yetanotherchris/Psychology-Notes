| Alternative hypothesis     | What will happen according to the hypothesis, the opposite of the null hypothesis. e.g. 'Students who sleep more perform better on tests.'                                       |
| Averages                   | Central values of data. e.g. mean, median, mode - measures of central tendency                                                                                                   |

| Hypothesis: one tailed     | A hypothesis that predicts the direction of the two variables, e.g. extra cheese leads to worst sleep                                                                            |
| Hypothesis: two tailed     | A hypothesis that is neutral about the direction or relationship of the two variables                                                                                            |

| Quantitative data          | Numerical data. e.g. height, temperature.                                                                                                                                        |
| Quasi experimental         | An experimental design without random assignment. e.g. comparing student performance across two existing classes.                                                                |
| Range                      | Difference between highest and lowest values. e.g. if scores range from 60 to 90, the range is 30.                                                                               |
| Sample                     | Selecting a subset of a population. e.g. choosing 100 students from a university.                                                                                                |
| Sampling variation         | Each time you choose 10 subjects for your sample, you might get variation in the mean of the value you want to measure, e.g. height. It might also be different from the population. Sample size is important, and inferential statistics are used to generalise to the population. |
| Sampling error             | Error from using a sample instead of the full population. e.g. survey results differ from actual population values.                                                              |
| Sampling error: Type 1     | Rejecting a true null hypothesis. e.g. concluding a drug works when it doesn't.                                                                                                  |
| Sampling error: Type 2     | Failing to reject a false null hypothesis. e.g. missing the effect of a useful drug.                                                                                             |
| Scale                      | Measurement system classifying data. e.g. nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio scales.                                                                                              |
| Scatterplot                | Graph showing a two variable relationship. e.g. height vs. weight.                                                                                                               |
| Standard deviation         | Spread of data around the mean. e.g. SD = 2 means most scores lie within 2 points of the mean.                                                                                   |
| Statistical significance   | In psychology, statistical significance occurs when the p-value, calculated from a test like chi-squared, is less than 0.05 (5%). This means there's less than a 5% chance the results are due to random variation if the null hypothesis is true, so we reject it for the alternative hypothesis. |
| Within participants        | The same group of people are affected by different conditions of the independent variable, e.g. juror's guilty verdict before and after deliberation                             |

|:---------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Ordinal                    | Data with a clear order, the interval between each value isn't always equal (e.g., rankings, scariest horror films, GCSE, A Level, BSc, Ph.D.).                                  |
| Interval                   | Ordered items with equal spacing, and no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius, IQ, dates in a calendar).|
| Ratio                      | Ordered, equal spacing, and has a true zero (e.g. height, money, weight, age). You can form ratios from the data e g 50kg is double 25kg.|


## Statistical test types / designs
| Concept                    | Definition                                                                                                                                                                       |
|:---------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chi-squared                | Test for relationship between categorical variables. e.g. testing if gender is related to voting preference.                                                                     |
| Correlational              | A type of research design that examines the relationship between variables without manipulation. e.g. measuring the relationship between hours studied and exam scores.          |
| Independent t-test         | |
| Paired samples t-test      | |
|Pearson correlation test|when the data are interval or ratio|

## Sampling Error

The group in the study is the sample. The wider group is the population, which depends on the research question.
The sample is generalised to the population.

Sampling error is the natural variability between a sample estimate and the true population value.

Let’s say the true average IQ in a country is 100.

- A small sample of 10 people might give you an average of 105 or 95 — lots of variation.
- A large sample of 1,000 people might give you 99.8 or 100.2 — closer to the true value.
- Both have sampling error, but the larger sample has less.

### Formula
Standard Error (SE) = s / sqrt(n)
​ 
Where:
𝑠 = sample standard deviation
𝑛 = sample size

### Reducing error
Reducing sampling error:
- Larger sample size
- Random sampling to reduce bias
- Stratified sampling (key groups being represented)


### Pearson's R values

You can be negative values, so -1 is a perfect negative linear relationship.

| **r value** | **Interpretation / Strength** |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| 0.00 – 0.10 | **Negligible / Very weak**    |
| 0.10 – 0.39 | **Weak**                      |
| 0.40 – 0.69 | **Moderate**                  |
| 0.70 – 0.89 | **Strong**                    |
| 0.90 – 1.00 | **Very strong / Excellent**   |


### Measures of the magnitude of an effect

- Standardised mean difference measures (d, g, Δ) — quantify how far apart two groups are in SD units
- Correlation coefficients (r, ρ) — quantify the strength of association between two continuous variables
- Variance-accounted-for measures (R², η², ω²) — quantify proportion of variance explained
- Association measures for categorical data (odds ratio, φ, Cramér's V, Cohen's w) — quantify relationships in contingency tables

| η² (eta-squared) | Variance explained | 0 to 1 | 0.01 | 0.06 | 0.14 | ANOVA; tends to overestimate |
| Partial η² | Variance explained | 0 to 1 | 0.01 | 0.06 | 0.14 | ANOVA; controls for other factors |
| ω² (omega-squared) | Variance explained | 0 to 1 | 0.01 | 0.06 | 0.14 | Less biased than η² |
| Cohen's f | ANOVA effect | 0 to +∞ | 0.1 | 0.25 | 0.4 | Related to η²; used in power analysis |
| Odds ratio | Association | 0 to +∞ | 1.5 | 2.5 | 4.0 | Categorical outcomes; 1 = no effect |
| Cohen's w | Chi-square | 0 to +∞ | 0.1 | 0.3 | 0.5 | Categorical data |
| φ (phi) | Association | -1 to +1 | 0.1 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 2×2 contingency tables |

The benchmarks come from Cohen (1988).
