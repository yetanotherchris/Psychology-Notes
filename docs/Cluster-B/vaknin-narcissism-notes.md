# Notes from Sam Vaknin on Narcissism
https://www.youtube.com/@samvaknin

### Basic test for Narcissism (pathological or traits of)

_Does the person exhibit the following?_

**Remorse**  
A normal person will show a modocom of embarrassment and repeatedly and publically show remorse.
This is contrasted with fake/feigned remorse that is always private and fleeting. When challenged they will becomes angry.
Healthy people have remorse that is long lasting.

**Remediation**  
Normal people will attempt to fix and make reparations that bare some relevance to what went wrong.
Narcissist will minimise their wrong doing, and show an insultingly low amount of remeditation. Or often just not offer any at all and deny what they did.
Remidation and remorse form a normal healthy mind: "wiedergutmachen" or making it good again.

**Restoration**  
Giving the victim closure and allowing them to go through the abuse and if possible they can forgive you and move on. A restored sense of justice and allowing them the ability to trust again.

### Mentally ill vs mentally healthy definition
Mentally healthy people:

1.  Control their impulses;
2.  Are aware of the consequences of their actions;
3.  Choose always to minimize harm to others and to themselves (self-love and empathy).

### Coping methods employed by someone living with a Narcissist

- Being subservient to the narcissist
- Countering (fighting back against the narcissist)
- Mirroring the narcissist
- Displacement - teaming up to abuse a 3rd party to get rid of the abuse against you, e.g bullying a child, projecting it onto the child.

### Intermittent reinforcement

(false hope, approach avoidance)

This appears in the form of being very loving, and then being indifferent or unkind - a form of classical conditioning (also respondent conditioning and Pavlovian conditioning). 
There are 4 types - 

- *Fixed interval* - a message or behaviour which can be bad or good. E.g. Every two weeks something good happens (or bad). The victim develops abuse tolerance.
- *Variable schedule* - unpredictable. The victim receives the reward or opposite and it's delivered abruptly - the unpredictable nature makes it stronger. The idea is to create and then relieve your anxiety.
- *Fixed ratio schedule* : affection after several responses from the victim. They also want a rise out of the victim that is visible from what they're doing. This is akin to Pavlovian conditioning: the pain is anticipated and is craved to get the reward. E.g. 5 crying responses or 2 self harming and then empathy is given.
- *Variable ratio schedule*: as the fixed ratio schedule but not fixed. Once, then maybe 7 times.

Ultimately the victim becomes more amenable to manipulation, and trauma bonded.  
Mentally ill people bond, NT people just walk away from abuse.  
Mentally ill objectify people rather than treating them as people.

### Why they can't hear you or understand what you are saying
A form of Attention narrowing, but it's not the ASD/Autistic type

### Commitment asymmetry & Effort reward imbalance
Why is the effort in the relationship often one sided, or when it's balanced this is spodaric?

### Trauma Bonding in the relationship
[Trauma bonding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAPAVC4_sOw)

- There is power asymmetry in the relationship, often one sided and intermittent: morning hot, then an hour later cold or indifferent (e.g. attention narrowing).
- The other will confuse intensity with truth  
- The other will confuse attention for love, e.g. jealousy. The other will dread being lonely (BPD/ASD).  
- Self-justify it - "I got what I deserved", "the abuse is happening for a good reason", "I had it coming" (bad self object)
- Or minimised, or state dependent memory. Forgetting. Or the abuse isn't very frequent, it's ok. Malignant optimism. Autoplastic - self blame.
- Betrayal trauma (@10mins) - betrayal trauma blindness : when the other is not allowed to communicate the breach of trust, or negative emotions.
  - Can't express your experience to someone you depend on in a crucial way. Denial and repression lead to severe mental health outcomes - dependency & mental health.
- Trauma bond is the strongest bond we know, more than mother-child because of multiple psychological needs, you're hopeless.
