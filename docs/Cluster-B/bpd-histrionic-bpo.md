# Dramatic Displays in Borderline Personality Organization (including Histrionic): A Psychoanalytic Perspective

_Via GPT 5 (using infidelity as the example)_

## Introduction

Individuals with a **borderline personality organization (BPO)** often exhibit intense emotional reactivity and dramatic behavior in interpersonal conflicts. A hallmark example is a *public outburst* when confronted with an accusation of infidelity – even when the individual has, in fact, been unfaithful. Such displays (e.g. screaming, crying, or causing a scene in a restaurant or street) can be understood through psychoanalytic lenses that emphasize underlying identity disturbance, primitive defenses, and affect dysregulation. Notably, *borderline pathology* is characterized by *identity diffusion* (an unstable sense of self) and extreme reactions to perceived abandonment or criticism. For instance, DSM-5 criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder include *“frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment”* and *“inappropriate, intense anger”* – features often manifest in explosive responses to a partner’s reproach. This report will critically examine the motivations for such infidelity-related outbursts, focusing on how **primitive defenses** (splitting, projection, projective identification, denial) and **emotional dysregulation** function to protect a fragile self. The role of **comorbid narcissistic and histrionic traits** in managing guilt, shame, and threats to self-image will be explored, drawing on classic and contemporary psychoanalytic theorists (Kernberg, Fonagy, Gabbard) and relevant literature. We will consider how the dramatic behavior serves *defensive purposes* – as deflection, displacement, or manipulation of the relational dynamic – given the individual’s structural vulnerabilities and personality style.

## Identity Diffusion and Primitive Defenses in Borderline Personality Organization

According to Kernberg’s object-relations theory, borderline personality organization is defined by **identity diffusion** (a poorly integrated self-concept) and reliance on **primitive defense mechanisms**. The borderline individual cannot cohesively reconcile positive and negative self/other representations, leading to *dissociated ego states* that compartmentalize “good” and “bad” parts of experience. When an unfaithful individual with BPO is accused of cheating, this accusation strikes at an already unstable self-structure. Admitting wrongdoing would require integrating the “bad” self-image of *one who betrays* with their idealized self, a psychological task they are ill-equipped to manage due to identity diffusion. Instead, **primitive defenses** are activated reflexively to maintain a tolerable self-view. Kernberg noted that identity diffusion in BPO goes hand-in-hand with primitive defenses like *splitting*, *projective identification*, and *dissociation*. These mechanisms distort reality in the service of defending the ego.

**Splitting** – the unconscious division of people and oneself into all-good vs. all-bad – is a classic defense in borderline and narcissistic personalities. In the context of infidelity confrontation, splitting may cause the individual to *devalue* the accusing partner instantly (seeing them as a cruel persecutor) while regarding oneself as an innocent victim. Nuance is lost; one party is entirely “bad” for causing this shame, and the self is entirely “good” (or unjustly attacked). This preserves a positive self-image by *disowning* the “bad” aspects of oneself (the infidelity) and projecting them outward. Otto Kernberg observed that BPO patients oscillate between disparate ego states – for example, a contrite, “good” self versus a hateful, “bad” self – because splitting prevents integrating these self-images. The accusation of cheating triggers a swing into a *defensive ego state* where the partner is seen as wholly antagonistic, which justifies an aggressive or histrionic counter-attack.

**Projection** is another central defense at play. Through projection, the individual attributes their own unacceptable feelings or transgressions to *others*, thus avoiding conscious guilt. It is not uncommon for someone who has been unfaithful to *accuse their partner of infidelity*, deflecting the blame and guilt outward. Indeed, projection is *“particularly prevalent”* in borderline and narcissistic personality disorders, as it allows the person to handle uncomfortable emotions (like guilt or shame) by seeing them in others rather than in themselves. In our scenario, the accused individual might heatedly allege, “*You’re the one cheating on me!*” or insist their partner’s distrust is the real betrayal, thereby turning the tables. Such **infidelity projection** *“reflects their own guilt and insecurity”*, serving to protect the individual’s self-esteem by shifting focus. By externalizing the “unfaithful” role onto the partner, they ward off the threatening recognition of themselves as the wrongdoer.

**Denial** is a further primitive defense likely to appear immediately. The person may flatly *deny the affair* or minimize its significance despite evidence. Denial allows an unconscious **refusal to accept reality** in order to avoid shame. Borderline-level personalities often use denial alongside splitting – for example, dismissing concrete proof of infidelity as a “misunderstanding” or claiming the accuser is imagining things. This defense can be adamant and dramatic: the individual might publicly proclaim their fidelity with performative outrage or tears, trying to *nullify the reality* of their betrayal in the minds of others and themselves.

**Projective identification**, a more complex process, is also relevant in these confrontations. In projective identification, the individual not only projects an intolerable feeling onto the other person but also behaves in a way that pressures the other to *feel* or enact that projection. A person with BPO may unconsciously induce their partner (and even onlookers) to feel the very emotions that the borderline individual cannot tolerate in themselves. For instance, overwhelmed by inner guilt and self-loathing, they might accuse the partner of being cruel and unloving until the partner actually *feels guilty* or uncertain, effectively absorbing the projected blame. The unfaithful individual might theatrically sob, *“I can’t believe you would humiliate me like this!”* – casting the accuser as a heartless persecutor. This can make the partner feel *ashamed* for having confronted them. The **“displaced insecurities or uncomfortable emotions”** of the unfaithful person are thus implanted into the partner. Through such projective identification, the borderline individual manages to offload unbearable feelings (guilt, inferiority, “badness”) onto the other and manipulate the emotional tone of the interaction. Kernberg described this dynamic as *“oscillating projections of unwanted self and object representations”* – a borderline patient will repeatedly project disowned parts of self onto others, leading others to experience and even enact those disowned feelings. In a public accusation scenario, this might mean the previously calm accuser is provoked into an angry or apologetic stance, while the borderline person assumes the role of the aggrieved party – effectively **reversing roles** via induced feelings.

Other primitive defenses may also emerge, such as **devaluation** (diminishing the partner’s worth or credibility: *“No one will ever believe you over me, you’re paranoid and pathetic!”*), or **rationalization** (excusing the infidelity as the partner’s fault: “I only strayed because you neglect me”). In one illustrative account, a woman with cluster B traits *justified her longstanding cheating by blaming her husband*: *“She said it was because I didn’t pay enough attention to her… The cheating was my fault because I didn’t make her feel beautiful.”*. This exemplifies *defensive rationalization* intertwined with projection – she assigns cause to the partner’s supposed failings, preserving her own self-image as someone driven to infidelity rather than freely choosing it. What all these defenses share is an underlying refusal to truly confront the person’s own culpability and an effort to *expel the bad self*. The moment of accusation is experienced as a grave threat to the borderline individual’s tenuous identity, and so the psyche mobilizes any distortion necessary to maintain internal equilibrium.

## Emotional Dysregulation, Shame, and Identity Threat

Beyond specific defense mechanisms, **emotional dysregulation** is a core feature of borderline pathology that fuels these dramatic outbursts. Individuals with BPO have *marked difficulty modulating their affects*, especially under stress. When confronted with their infidelity, they are flooded with intense emotions – panic, shame, anger, fear of rejection – and lack the capacity to soothe or temper these feelings. Instead, the affect overwhelms them, often spilling out in uncontrolled ways. Clinically, those at the borderline level demonstrate “difficulty regulating emotions and impulses,” often resulting in *outbursts of anger* and unstable behavior under duress. The public nature of the confrontation can amplify feelings of humiliation or betrayal, further escalating the response. Minor provocation can trigger *disproportionate rage or despair* because the individual’s emotional thermostat is so sensitive (a phenomenon sometimes described as *affective instability* or *“hypersensitivity to rejection”*). In psychoanalytic terms, the accusation of wrongdoing strikes at a deeply vulnerable spot – the person’s sense of being worthy of love – and this can unleash what Kohut called **narcissistic injury**.

For individuals with *narcissistic traits* (often co-occurring in BPO), being accused or exposed as “bad” is experienced as an intolerable assault on their self-esteem. The result can be **narcissistic rage** – an extreme, defensive anger aimed at the source of the injury. Kohut famously described *narcissistic rage* as a **“forceful response to narcissistic injury”**, distinct from ordinary anger. In our scenario, the narcissistic aspect of the personality may respond to the partner’s allegation as a profound ego wound (shattering their grandiose self-image as a “good” partner). The ensuing rage is not truly proportional to the situation; it is fueled by primitive terror of inferiority and humiliation. Glen Gabbard notes that such patients often exhibit **intense, chaotic emotional reactions** that can seem baffling to others, driven by primitive defenses like splitting and projection that *amp up* interpersonal conflicts. The **attachment dynamics** are also crucial: a borderline individual typically has an *intense fear of abandonment*. Being confronted for cheating immediately raises the specter that their partner will leave or stop loving them. This *abandonment panic* acts as an emotional detonator, triggering frantic, extreme behaviors (consistent with Criterion 1 of BPD: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment). **Paradoxically, the very outburst meant to pull the partner back or punish them for “hurting” the borderline individual can further destabilize the relationship, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of chaos and potential abandonment.**

**Shame** is perhaps the most powerful affect driving the dramatic behavior in this context. Psychoanalytic thinkers differentiate shame from guilt: **guilt** arises from specific bad *actions* and can spur reparative efforts, whereas **shame** is the feeling that *the entire self is bad or defective*, often leading to hiding or rage. In an infidelity confrontation, the person with BPO is likely to feel profound *shame* at being “caught” – a sense that their true flawed self is exposed for all to see. Research has shown that *shame-prone individuals often respond with anger and blame to rid themselves of the painful feeling*. In fact, **shame has been linked to externalization of blame and aggression** in borderline patients. Unlike guilt (which might lead one to apologize or make amends), shame in these personalities tends to evoke **attack as a defense**: *“If I can make *you* the bad guy, I won’t have to feel how bad I am.”* Empirical studies on emotion have found that while both guilt and shame can be distressing, **shame more strongly correlates with anger and self-destructive behaviors** in BPD. One analysis noted that those dealing with shame feel as if their “flaws were exposed for others to see, provoking an intense desire to escape from such scrutiny”. In the public outburst, we see exactly this dynamic: the individual is desperate to *escape or negate the exposure*. They may literally try to flee the scene, or metaphorically escape shame by transforming it into dramatic indignation or despair.

From a **mentalization** perspective (Fonagy et al.), the confrontation likely triggers a collapse in the person’s ability to reflect on mental states (their own or the partner’s). Attachment theorists propose that under high stress – especially involving attachment figures – individuals with BPD regress to pre-mentalizing modes of functioning. The accusation of infidelity is a severe interpersonal stressor that can momentarily destroy the person’s capacity to *mentalize* (i.e., to think about what they and the other are feeling in a nuanced, reflective way). Instead, they may enter a *hyperaroused, survival mode* where only raw emotion and simplistic black-and-white thinking prevail. Fonagy’s work suggests that borderline patients under threat shift into modes like **“psychic equivalence”** (where internal feelings are experienced as external reality) or **“teleological stance”** (where only actions, not mental states, are perceived as real). In this case, the individual *feels* accused, attacked, and abandoned – and in that moment, it is as if the partner truly is a villain and the world is collapsing. The ability to recognize that the partner’s accusation might stem from hurt or betrayal (the partner’s mental state) evaporates; likewise, the ability to reflect on one’s own guilt is overwhelmed by self-protective anger or panic. Mentalization-based therapy literature emphasizes that *instability of attachment* and resulting failures of mentalization are core dysfunctions in BPD. When epistemic trust is low (i.e. the person cannot trust that others have benign intentions), the individual with BPD will react to accusations as outright attacks, not opportunities for truth or reconciliation. This can explain the *disproportionate interpretation* – the partner’s confrontation is seen not as an attempt to address a relationship problem, but as a hostile act of rejection or cruelty. The borderline individual’s *emotional truth* (“I am being abandoned and annihilated right now”) comes to eclipse actual facts (“I cheated and my partner is justifiably upset”). In effect, **high emotional arousal “short-circuits” rational thought and self-control**, leading to the kind of impulsive, unfiltered outburst observed. Peter Fonagy might say that the individual has lost the capacity to mentalize in that instant, reverting to primitive defenses and raw affect as the only means to communicate their distress. The public nature of the setting can also serve as an *unconscious trigger* – if the individual has past attachment traumas involving shame in front of others, the scenario could resonate with those feelings and intensify the disorganized response.

## Narcissistic and Histrionic Traits: Managing Guilt, Shame, and Self-Image

It is important to recognize that many individuals with a borderline personality organization also exhibit features of **narcissistic** or **histrionic** personality disorders (the cluster B overlap). These comorbid traits can significantly color the flavor of the outburst and the methods used to cope with guilt or shame.

**Narcissistic traits** in this context contribute to a heightened sensitivity to shame and an impaired capacity for genuine guilt. Narcissistic personalities maintain an *inflated or idealized self-image* which must be protected at all costs. If a person with narcissistic features has committed infidelity, on some level they have violated their own ideal self-standards, which evokes shame. But instead of healthy guilt (acknowledging wrongdoing), the narcissistic defense system will seek to *avoid admitting fault* to preserve the grandiose self. This often manifests as **outright denial, indignation, and rage toward the accuser**. The accusation is perceived as a *narcissistic injury* – an insult that threatens to expose their imperfections. As discussed, the response may be a ferocious **rage** or argumentativeness aimed at refuting the accusation and punishing the accuser for the humiliation caused. Narcissistic traits also bring **entitlement and lack of empathy**: the individual may feel entitled to have cheated (“I needed it, I deserve to be happy”) and at the same time lack empathy for the partner’s feelings of betrayal. This combination can lead them to respond as though *they* are the one who has been wronged, rather than the one who acted wrongly. Clinicians have observed that narcissistic patients are often *highly skilled at lying and maintaining a facade* to protect their image. Even when confronted with evidence, they may persist in fabrications or quickly pivot to *character assassination* of the accuser (“You’re crazy, everyone knows how unstable you are, you’re making this up”). One anecdotal account of a narcissistic-histrionic wife described how, once evidence of her affairs was undeniable, *“she began flaunting her cheating… Cheating wasn’t her flaw; it was mine somehow. She used it to belittle me and make herself the poor victim.”*. This striking example shows the *brazen lack of remorse* and the twisting of the narrative to maintain a superior self-image: she reframed her infidelity as her husband’s fault and even as something that *she* suffered (turning herself into a victim of his “failings”). Such cognitive and emotional maneuvers illustrate narcissistic defenses in action – **projection of fault, blaming, and an emotional callousness to the actual harm done**. Internally, these maneuvers protect the person from collapsing into shame; externally, they serve to **manipulate others’ perceptions** so that the narcissistic individual can avoid consequences and even extract sympathy.

Narcissistic comorbidity can also heighten the **grandiosity** in the dramatic display. The person might make sweeping, grandiose pronouncements during the outburst (*“No one has treated me as badly as you have!”* or *“I am the one who has sacrificed everything in this marriage!”*), painting themselves as exceptionally noble or wronged. This can be seen as a form of **idealization of self and devaluation of other** – a classic narcissistic split. Kernberg pointed out that narcissistic personalities often operate on a borderline level of organization, with the same defenses of splitting and projective identification present. Thus, in our scenario, the narcissistic features essentially *intensify* the borderline defenses: the splitting is more absolute (accuser is *all villain*, self is *all innocent*), the projection is more accusatory and disdainful, and the rage is more cold or contemptuous. Moreover, narcissistic individuals have difficulty with **authentic guilt** because their superego (conscience) tends to be underdeveloped or externalized; instead of feeling remorse internally, they fear *shame and judgment from others*. Therefore, their emotional energy goes into avoiding shame (by *shifting blame and attacking credibility*) rather than sincerely apologizing or repairing. If they do express contrition, it might be superficial or a calculated performance to regain favor rather than a deeply felt guilt. This psychological structure explains why genuine accountability is rare in such confrontations – it is *too ego-threatening*.

**Histrionic traits**, on the other hand, infuse the situation with **exaggerated emotionality, attention-seeking, and a performative quality**. Histrionic personality disorder is characterized by *dramatic, theatrical expression of emotions, shallow but rapidly shifting feelings, and a craving for center-stage attention*. When a borderline individual has histrionic features, their reaction to an infidelity accusation is likely to be **flamboyantly emotional**. Instead of (or in addition to) rage, they may explode into **hysterical tears, pleading, or even a scene of fainting or illness** – any behavior that seizes the spotlight and elicits sympathy. The motive here is often to **redirect the narrative**: the histrionic side of the person instinctively tries to *“turn the story around in which they are the victim,”* as one description puts it. Indeed, *“when they fall from grace, histrionics are more at risk for depression, crying fits, and desperation to turn the story around with themselves as the victim”*. In a public confrontation, a histrionic-borderline individual might suddenly wail *“How can you do this to me?!”* and portray themselves as *betrayed* rather than as the betrayer. The extreme emotional display (weeping loudly, perhaps clutching onto the partner or dramatically running away in tears) serves to **solicit the attention and pity of bystanders** and the partner. By making a *spectacle* of their own distress, they shift the focus away from the original issue (their infidelity) to the *immediate spectacle of their suffering*. Histrionic traits also involve a high degree of **suggestibility and shallow processing** of events – the person may genuinely convince themselves in the moment that they are heartbroken victims, not merely acting. Their emotions can flip rapidly; for example, they might move from sobbing to anger to flirtatious pleading in short order, which can be very bewildering to others. This mercurial quality is part of the **emotional dysregulation** in BPD, but with a histrionic flair the shifts often aim at sustaining engagement from others (they don’t want the partner to withdraw).

Additionally, **attention-seeking behavior** in histrionic individuals means they are acutely attuned to the *audience* in a public setting. The public outburst may unconsciously function as *a stage performance*. By ensuring that the conflict becomes dramatic, the histrionic person gathers an implicit audience (restaurant patrons, people on the street, etc.) who witness them in a sympathetic light. Being at the center of a dramatic scene can actually feed the histrionic need for attention, even though the ostensible content is negative. They may later describe the event in overly theatrical terms, emphasizing how *emotionally intense* it was for them, possibly downplaying the original transgression. There is often a flirtation with chaos in histrionic-borderline behavior: stormy scenes, breakups and reconciliations in public, extravagant gestures (e.g. shouting “I’ll just die without you!” in front of everyone). These behaviors can be understood as attempts to *externally regulate internal chaos* – by amplifying it outwardly, the person paradoxically feels in control of the narrative (since they direct the theatrics). Moreover, the **shame** of being accused can be quickly converted into *performative guilt or despair* that still centers on *their* feelings rather than the partner’s. For example, instead of quietly feeling ashamed for cheating, a histrionic person might cry about how *they* “can’t live with being falsely accused” or even threaten self-harm to signal their emotional anguish. Both narcissistic and histrionic traits can involve such **suicidal gestures or threats under stress** – *“both may use threats of suicide as an attention grab or a way to obtain sympathy and forgiveness”*. In a heated infidelity confrontation, a dramatic *“I’ll kill myself if you leave me!”* shouted in public is a dramatic gambit not only to derail the accusation but to *guilt the partner into backing down*. This highlights how **guilt and perceived threats to self-image are managed by externalized drama**: rather than quietly experiencing guilt and remorse, the individual makes a grand display that forces others to attend to their emotional state.

In sum, **narcissistic features** tend to add *defensiveness, entitlement, and rageful denial*, whereas **histrionic features** contribute *expressive, attention-commanding emotionality*. Many individuals with BPO might have *mixes of both*: for instance, initial narcissistic rage (“How dare you accuse me!”) followed by histrionic collapse into tears (“Don’t leave me, I can’t live without you!”). Both styles share an ultimate aim of preserving the person’s *psychic equilibrium* by avoiding a stable recognition of their own moral failing. The *guilt* that might ordinarily follow infidelity is essentially transmuted into other emotions – **indignation, self-pity, desperation** – that the person finds easier to tolerate or that serve a function in the relationship. Notably, these cluster B traits also interfere with the development of *authentic empathy* for the wronged partner. In the heat of the moment, the borderline individual’s capacity to appreciate the partner’s hurt is severely compromised. The inner narrative is *entirely self-focused*: *“I am being attacked/unloved/unappreciated”* rather than *“I caused pain to someone I love.”* This egocentric absorption is partly defensive (not thinking of the partner’s pain means not facing one’s responsibility for it) and partly a feature of the personality structure (narcissistic self-involvement or histrionic egocentricity).

## Defensive Functions of the Dramatic Outburst

From a functional standpoint, the **dramatic public outburst** in response to an infidelity accusation serves several *defense-oriented purposes* for the personality in question. While on the surface the behavior appears self-defeating or excessively theatrical, on a deeper level it operates as a complex coping strategy aimed at protecting the individual’s psyche and maneuvering the interpersonal situation. Key defensive functions include:

* **Deflection of Focus:** The outburst acts as a **deflection** – shifting attention away from the factual issue (the individual’s infidelity) and onto the *scene* being caused. By yelling, sobbing, or creating chaos, the individual effectively changes the subject; the immediate task for everyone becomes calming them down or dealing with the public disturbance, rather than examining the truth of the accusation. This *diversion* protects the person from further scrutiny. It externalizes the conflict in a way that clouds the original transgression. In psychoanalytic terms, this relates to **distraction through acting out** – instead of mentally processing guilt, the person “acts out” emotions which hijack the interaction. Observers might even forget that the person was accused of cheating, remembering only how emotionally distraught (or vehemently defensive) they were. The deflection is closely tied to projection and denial. For example, by vehemently insisting on their innocence and reacting as if *deeply wounded*, they deflect the conversation toward their *feelings* (“I’m so hurt you’d say that!”) rather than their *actions*. This strategy often yields a tactical advantage: a partner who intended to press about the affair may become confused, apologetic, or at least too distracted to obtain a clear admission of guilt. Essentially, **the truth is drowned out by the noise of the drama**. Deflection can also involve *blaming the confrontation itself* – e.g., *“This is not about me, it’s about your cruel way of accusing me in public”* – thereby putting the accuser on the defensive for *their* behavior instead. We see here an interpersonal enactment of *blame-shifting*, which is a common consequence of shame-fueled projection.

* **Displacement of Guilt and Aggression:** The public blow-up allows the individual to **displace** their own guilt or self-anger outward as *anger toward the partner or others*. In classic Freudian terms, displacement is taking emotions that rightfully belong in one context and expressing them in another, safer context. The cheating individual likely has some degree of guilt or self-directed anger (if only unconsciously) for their betrayal. Confrontation raises these feelings acutely. Rather than acknowledging them (*“I’m angry at myself for hurting my partner”*), the borderline strategy is to *convert all that affect into anger at the partner for “attacking” them*. The partner becomes a convenient target for aggression that possibly originates in self-loathing or fear. By **flipping guilt into indignation**, the person avoids collapsing into depression or remorse (which would require ego strength they don’t have at that moment). In practice, this may look like the accused lashing out: *“How dare you embarrass me like this! You’re the one who’s destroying our relationship!”* The intensity of the anger often far exceeds the apparent provocation, hinting that it includes displaced anger at oneself and perhaps at past figures (sometimes the accusing partner symbolically represents a critical parent or betrayer from the individual’s history, and the rage is displaced from those earlier relationships). This mechanism aligns with what object-relations theory calls *“turning passive into active”* – the individual who felt humiliated (passive shame) now actively humiliates or berates the other, reversing the roles and thus discharging the feeling in an inverted form. By displacing their **self-directed aggression outward**, they achieve a temporary relief from inner conflict; the enemy is no longer within (their own conscience) but without (the “unreasonable” partner). Additionally, displacement operates in service of **denial**: if all the anger is directed at the accuser, there is none left to aim at oneself, which means not having to accept responsibility. In summary, the outburst functions like an emotional lightning rod, channeling internal turmoil into external aggression.

* **Manipulation of the Relational Field:** Perhaps the most intricate function of the dramatic display is the **manipulation of the interpersonal or relational field**. By exploding in a public or extreme way, the individual *changes the roles and dynamics* between themselves, their partner, and even any witnesses. One aspect of this is inducing the partner (and others) to take on a *different role* – often flipping from anger to concern. A sudden crying meltdown, for instance, can trigger the partner’s caregiving instincts or embarrassment, prompting them to comfort the very person who betrayed them. The borderline individual, consciously or not, **engineers a scenario where they become the “distressed victim”** and the partner is pressured to shift from accuser to rescuer. Observers who are not privy to the whole story may sympathize with the one making the loud lament: *“Look how upset they are; the other person must have hurt them terribly.”* This social pressure can corner the partner into backing off the accusation to save face or appear compassionate. In essence, the intense emotions *manipulate the partner’s emotional responses*. This is closely related to projective identification, as discussed – the individual projects the role of *offender* onto the partner and *victim* onto self, and then **coaxes the partner to embody that script**. By doing so, they *manage the relational field* such that their own position is one-down (injured, needing care) and the partner’s is one-up (powerful, potentially abusive), which often causes the partner to relinquish the power position out of guilt or shame. It’s a destabilizing **role-reversal** strategy. Gabbard and other clinicians have noted that borderline patients can evoke strong *counter-transference* in others – meaning they unconsciously get others to feel what they themselves cannot handle – and in personal relationships this can translate to making the partner feel *responsible or guilty* for the very problem the borderline individual created. Here, the partner might end up apologizing for *accusing* or for the way they brought it up, while the original sin (the affair) remains unaddressed – a striking interpersonal maneuver.

Furthermore, the **public** nature of the outburst can be a tactical element of this manipulation. Having an audience often *constrains how the partner can respond*. If the partner was angry and intent on getting a confession, they may now feel they must temper their reaction to avoid looking like a bully in front of others. The cheating individual may even *exploit social norms*, knowing that by making a scene, the partner will likely want to de-escalate rather than continue a confrontation with onlookers watching. The situation becomes a kind of theater where the borderline/histrionic person can *write the narrative*. For example, by loudly wailing *“Why don’t you just trust me? I love you so much!”* in public, they send a message to everyone around that they are a devoted partner being unfairly doubted – essentially recruiting **social validation** for their side. This *triangulation* (bringing outside parties indirectly into the conflict) can leave the accuser isolated in their perspective. The term **“relational field”** implies that the behavior isn’t just about two individuals, but the *whole context* of their relationship environment; the dramatic act is designed to tilt that field to the borderline individual’s advantage, garnering sympathy, sowing confusion, and reducing the immediate threat to their self-image.

* **Avoidance of Accountability:** Underlying all the above is a fundamental defensive aim: **to avoid taking responsibility** for the infidelity. The dramatic outburst, in psychoanalytic interpretation, is a form of **resistance** against guilt. It *distracts, externalizes, and dramatizes* so that no clear space is left for a rational discussion of culpability. If the situation were calm, the partner could press for answers – *“Why did you do it? Will you admit it?”* – which would force the individual to confront reality. The chaos of an outburst effectively **derails that process**. It buys time and may completely prevent a truthful reckoning, as the confrontation often doesn’t reach a productive conclusion. In therapy, acting out is seen as the patient “evacuating” intolerable feelings into behavior instead of reflecting on them. Similarly, here the acting out of emotions prevents the conversation from reaching the point of resolution (e.g. admission or negotiation of forgiveness), keeping the individual un-accountable and in a victim-like posture. This defense is so ingrained that it is likely not a fully conscious ploy; rather, over years, the person’s personality has learned that *dramatic emotional displays get them out of trouble* – either by eliciting leniency or by exhausting others who eventually drop the issue. In some cases, this pattern becomes manipulative: for instance, if on previous occasions extreme emotional reactions caused the partner to forgive or forget other transgressions, the individual may *strategically* or habitually repeat the pattern. They might not think through it logically, but at a gut level they “know” that if they cry loud enough or threaten self-harm, the partner will shift from anger to concern. Thus, the public meltdown is a *learned defense mechanism* in the relational repertoire of cluster B individuals to maintain control when confronted.

It is worth noting that while these behaviors are “manipulative” in effect, they often stem from *deep psychological desperation rather than cold calculation*. The term **“primitive defense”** is apt: these are **primitive, early-life strategies** reactivated in an adult relational context. A borderline individual, having perhaps experienced traumatic abandonment or criticism in childhood, resorts to the same raw defenses (tantrums, blaming, hysterics) that might have once gotten their caregiver’s attention or deflected harm. Otto Kernberg and others have remarked that such patients did not integrate more mature ways to self-soothe or accept blame, leaving them with *developmentally early defenses* that persist into adult relationships. Their structural vulnerability – an unstable self that easily fragments under stress – *necessitates* these drastic measures (in their mind) to avoid psychological disintegration. In psychodynamic therapy, a lot of work goes into helping these individuals build tolerance for guilt and imperfection in themselves without resorting to splitting or acting out. Until such integration is achieved, the dramatic externalization remains their go-to coping mechanism.

## Conclusion

Confrontations over actual infidelity represent a perfect storm for individuals with a borderline personality organization, especially when complicated by narcissistic and histrionic features. The **psychoanalytic framework** helps illuminate that what might appear as sheer histrionic drama or manipulative outburst is, in fact, rooted in the person’s **structural psyche trying to defend itself**. **Identity diffusion** leaves them unable to reconcile being “good” with having done something “bad,” so primitive defenses like splitting, projection, and denial spring into action to purge the “bad” self onto others. **Emotional dysregulation** ensures that these defenses are not subtle, but rather come out as overwhelming affect – rage, panic, despair – that the individual cannot contain. **Shame** at being exposed fuels much of the fury and tears, since shame attacks the fragile self at its core, often converting quickly into anger and blame as a form of self-protection. The presence of **narcissistic traits** intensifies defensive grandiosity and rage, making the person zealously deny wrongdoing and attack the accuser to preserve self-image. **Histrionic traits** amplify the theatrical and attention-seeking quality of the reaction, with dramatic pleas for sympathy and displays of suffering meant to captivate the “audience” and the partner. Together, these elements mean the individual will go to great lengths to **externalize guilt and cast themselves as either the innocent victim or at least not the true villain** in the unfolding drama.

The **defensive functions** of the behavior – deflecting the focus, displacing inner turmoil onto the partner, and manipulating the relational dynamic – are ultimately in service of **avoiding a psychic collapse** or loss of self-coherence. It is a *desperate attempt to regulate unbearable feelings and preserve attachments*, even if the method is maladaptive. Kernberg’s classic writings on borderline states highlight that these patients often provoke intense reactions in others and create chaotic interpersonal scenes as a way to manage internal chaos. Fonagy’s work would add that their capacity to mentalize evaporates under pressure, so they *act out feelings rather than reflecting on them*. Gabbard and other clinicians remind us that while such behavior can feel extremely manipulative or aggressive to those on the receiving end, it is driven by primitive fears – fear of abandonment, fear of being unlovable, fear of shame. Thus, the *public outburst upon being accused of infidelity* can be seen as a form of **primitive self-defense**: the individual’s psyche is “cornered,” and like a cornered animal it lashes out with all or nothing tactics.

Understanding these dynamics has important implications for therapy and relationships. Clinicians like Kernberg advocate for *interpreting the defensive function* of such behaviors in therapy – helping the patient see, for example, that their furious denial is protecting them from unbearable guilt, and gradually building the ego strength to face their ambivalence (both loving and aggressive feelings) without splitting. Fonagy’s mentalization-based approach would focus on improving the person’s ability to recognize mental states (e.g., to reflect, *“I felt so ashamed that I tried to make him the bad guy”*) and to restore epistemic trust so they can learn from honest dialogue rather than instinctively perceiving confrontation as attack. In a real-world relationship, partners of individuals with BPD/NPD/HPD traits often need support to navigate these tumultuous episodes without reinforcing the maladaptive patterns. It can be a delicate balance to hold the person accountable (for the infidelity, in this case) while also not escalating the situation to dangerous levels. The psychoanalytic perspective encourages maintaining **firm boundaries** (not allowing reality to be completely obfuscated by the drama) yet also maintaining **empathy for the underlying pain** driving the drama.

In conclusion, the scenario of a dramatic public outburst when a borderline-organized individual is accused of cheating exemplifies how **deep structural vulnerabilities manifest in overt behavior**. The interplay of identity diffusion, primitive defenses, and affect dysregulation creates a *theater of coping* – a chaotic scene that paradoxically protects the individual from an even more chaotic inner collapse. Comorbid narcissistic entitlement and histrionic expressiveness shape the form of the performance, whether it skews more toward rageful denial or pitiable melodrama. The behavior functions defensively as a *psychological smoke screen* (hiding the transgression behind emotional fog) and as a *weapon* in the relational battlefield (disarming the accuser and seizing the victim role). By drawing on both classic theories (e.g. Kernberg’s structural model of BPO, Kohut’s narcissistic injury, Kleinian projection) and contemporary insights (e.g. Fonagy’s mentalization failure, empirical studies on shame in BPD), we gain a nuanced understanding of this complex clinical phenomenon. Such understanding ultimately fosters more effective interventions and compassion for all involved: recognizing that behind the pyrotechnics of the public spectacle lies a desperate individual, fighting to protect a fragmented self from the unbearable pain of exposure, guilt, and potential loss.
