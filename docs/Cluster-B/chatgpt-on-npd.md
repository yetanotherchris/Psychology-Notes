# ChatGPT on Narcissism

v4 of ChatGPT, estimated at over 500 billion parameters, gives its thoughts on narcissistic behaviours.

## Apologies
Narcissists may use a range of insincere apology tactics, including:

- Minimizing: "It wasn't a big deal; why are you so upset?"
- Conditional Apology: "I’m sorry _if_ I upset you" (implying it’s your sensitivity at fault).
- Blame-Shifting: "I’m sorry, but you made me do it."
- Self-Victimizing: "I’m sorry I’m such a terrible person; I can’t do anything right."
- Deflecting: "Let’s just move on; why dwell on the past?"
- Guilt-Tripping: "I said I’m sorry. What else do you want from me?"
- Superficial: A quick "I’m sorry" without follow-up actions to address the issue or change the behavior.

These types of apologies lack accountability or a sincere effort to repair the relationship.
Responses:

1. Respond neutrally without rewarding manipulative behavior – **Acknowledge Without Validation**.  
   - Example: "I hear you, but I need some time to process this."
2. Assert your feelings and highlight the need for meaningful action – **Set Boundaries with Accountability**.  
   - Example: "I appreciate the apology, but I need to see actions that show things will change."
3. Prompt deeper discussion to gauge their understanding of the issue – **Ask for Clarification**.  
   - Example: "Can you explain what you’re apologizing for?"
4. Avoid over-explaining or justifying your feelings – **Don’t Over-Explain**.  
   - Example: "I’ve shared how I feel, and that’s what matters to me."
5. Shift the focus to their actions and willingness to make changes – **Redirect to Accountability**.  
   - Example: "What steps are you willing to take to ensure this doesn’t happen again?"
6. Stay calm and prioritize your emotional well-being – **Stay Calm and Detached**.  
   - Example: "Let’s revisit this later. I need some space right now."
