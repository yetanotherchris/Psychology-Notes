| Quasi experimental         | An experimental design without random assignment. e.g. comparing student performance across two existing classes.                                                                |
| Range                      | Difference between highest and lowest values. e.g. if scores range from 60 to 90, the range is 30.                                                                               |

| Sample                     | Selecting a subset of a population. e.g. choosing 100 students from a university.                                                                                                |
| Sampling variation         | Each time you choose 10 subjects for your sample, you might get variation in the mean of the value you want to measure, e.g. height. It might also be different from the population. Sample size is important, and inferential statistics are used to generalise to the population. |
| Sampling error             | Error from using a sample instead of the full population. e.g. survey results differ from actual population values.                                                              |
| Sampling error: Type 1     | Rejecting a true null hypothesis. e.g. concluding a drug works when it doesn't.                                                                                                  |
| Sampling error: Type 2     | Failing to reject a false null hypothesis. e.g. missing the effect of a useful drug.                                                                                             |
| Scale                      | Measurement system classifying data. e.g. nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio scales.                                                                                              |
| Scatterplot                | Graph showing a two variable relationship. e.g. height vs. weight.                                                                                                               |
| Standard deviation         | Spread of data around the mean. e.g. SD = 2 means most scores lie within 2 points of the mean.                                                                                   |
| Statistical significance   | In psychology, statistical significance occurs when the p-value, calculated from a test like chi-squared, is less than 0.05 (5%). This means there's less than a 5% chance the results are due to random variation if the null hypothesis is true, so we reject it for the alternative hypothesis. |
| Within participants        | The same group of people are affected by different conditions of the independent variable, e.g. juror's guilty verdict before and after deliberation                             |
