# Questionnaires & Inventories
The questions and choices for these questionnaires have been in part generated by a LLM, based on public material or the model itself. FQ was manually generated. 

All questionnaires are publically reproduceable for education purposes, based on the original paper's notes.

You may spot a trend with the list below and licensing. Even with the Open Science movement there's a big difference in philosophy between the software industry and Psychology. 

Open Source software is typically free to use and improve, but then licensed for commercial use and support. With Psychology inventories, questionnaires you can use them clinically and for educational purposes, but can't make derivitives or reproduce many of them. So SurveyJS and JSON format is a derivative and is a reproduction - which are the ones that have been removed.

**Note - the questionnaires below are NOT the original validated versions, the scoring is performed in Javascript. Full creditation and referencing is available on each questionnaire's final (scoring) page.**
