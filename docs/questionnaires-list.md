# Questionnaires & Inventories

The questions and choices for these questionnaires have been in part generated by a LLM, based on public material or the model itself. 

All questionnaires are publicly reproduceable for education purposes, based on the original paper's notes.

You may spot a trend with the list below and licensing. Even with the Open Science movement there's a big difference in philosophy between the software industry and Psychology. 

Open Source software is typically free to use and improve, but then licensed for commercial use and support. With Psychology inventories and questionnaires, you are free to use them clinically and for educational purposes, but can't make derivatives or reproduce many of them. So the SurveyJS and JSON format is a derivative and therefore is a reproduction - which are the ones that have been removed. 

Strangely the copyrighted ones are available for free on the internet as PDFs. So a counter argument to "no reproducing" would be: if they're available freely, and scoring errors are equally likely by clinicians (no questionnaires list required training), what restricts a digital transformation of them? And a rebutal to this counter argument is that digital copies may not be validated and tested properly. Which returns you to the philosophy of open source and perhaps the main problem with the open source movement - in reality most open source projects, except the really large projects, are not formally peer reviewed and bug fixing is a spare time activity unless when used commercially.

## Some caveats (the legal bit LLMs recommended putting in):

- They are **not diagnostic/screening tools** and should not be used for diagnosis/self-diagnosis.
- Results should be interpreted by qualified mental health professionals.
- Each instrument has specific age ranges and populations for which it has been validated.
- Professional clinical assessment involves multiple sources of information beyond questionnaires.
- Intended use: research and academic study, educational purposes.
- Not validated for anything beyond educational purposes.

**Attribution & Validation:**
Full citations to the original research and validation studies are provided on each questionnaire's scoring page. These implementations use the published instruments but are not endorsed by the original authors. Psychometric properties (reliability, validity, norms) apply to the original instruments as published, not necessarily to digital adaptations.
