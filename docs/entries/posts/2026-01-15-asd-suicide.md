# Autism and suicide

Does having ASD increase suicide chance and suicidal ideation?

<!-- more -->
Adults with Asperger's syndrome were significantly more likely to report lifetime experience of suicidal ideation than were individuals from a general UK population sample 

The paper highlights 9x higher ideation (95% confidence). This isn't completion, which could hypothetically protect from suicide (this is my theory, not the author's) because ideation becomes a normal cognitive state - "I'm alone" and "I'm a burden" (Interpersonal Theory of Suicide); and perhaps no inclusion of "I'm a burden" from social isolation.

> A majority of autistic adults (72%) scored above the recommended psychiatric cut-off for suicide risk on the SBQ-R; significantly higher than general population (GP) adults (33%).

People with ASD also have shortened life spans (12 years), often relating to the suicide ideation:

### What are suicide percentages in the UK?

[ONS 2023 data](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/suicidesintheunitedkingdom/2023)


| | Rate per 100,000 | As percentage |
|---|---|---|
| **Males (all ages)** | 17.4 | 0.017% |
| **Females (all ages)** | 5.7 | 0.006% |
| **Overall** | 11.4 | 0.011% |

**By age (2023):**

| Age group | Males per 100,000 | Females per 100,000 |
|---|---|---|
| 45-49 | 25.5 | — |
| 50-54 | — | 9.2 (highest for women) |

As percentages:

- Male baseline: 0.017% annual risk
- Female baseline: 0.006% annual risk
- Male 45-49: 0.026% annual risk (peak)
