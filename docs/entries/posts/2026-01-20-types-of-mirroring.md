| Phenomenon | Timing | What's Copied | Mechanism | Purpose/Function | When It Feels "Off" |
|------------|--------|---------------|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Childhood Mirroring** ([Meltzoff & Moore, 1977](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.198.4312.75)) | Infancy onwards | Facial expressions, vocalisations, movements | Innate developmental process; active intermodal mapping (AIM) | Learning, bonding, developing empathy and sense of self | N/A - normal development |
| **Mirror Neurons** ([di Pellegrino et al., 1992](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00230027); [Rizzolatti et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/119.2.593)) | Milliseconds | Motor actions, possibly emotions | Neurological - neurons fire both when performing and observing actions | Underpins imitation, empathy, action understanding | N/A - neurological substrate |
| **Chameleon Effect** ([Chartrand & Bargh, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.76.6.893)) | 2-5 seconds | Postures, gestures, mannerisms, facial expressions | Automatic, nonconscious perception-behaviour link | Social glue; increases liking and rapport unconsciously | Too fast (<2 sec), too precise, or too frequent - triggers suspicion |
| **Communication Accommodation Theory** ([Giles et al., 1973](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0047404500000701)) | Minutes to ongoing | Vocabulary, phrases, accent, speech rate, tone | Can be conscious or unconscious | Signalling affiliation, reducing social distance, seeking approval | When motive appears manipulative or self-serving |
| **Mimicry-Deception Theory** ([Jones, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691614535936)) | Variable - short or long-term | Emotions, cooperative behaviours, trustworthy signals | Deliberate, strategic - used to avoid detection | Exploitation, resource extraction, appearing trustworthy while deceiving | Short-term: rushed charm, quick exit. Long-term: mask slips under stress, history doesn't match |
| **Affective Mimicry in Psychopathy** ([Book et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40806-015-0012-x)) | Deliberate/on-demand | Fearful expressions, remorse, prosocial emotions | Cognitive understanding of emotion intact; emotional experience absent | "Mask of sanity" - appear genuine to exploit others | Cleckley's "emotional poverty" - the affect is technically correct but hollow |
