# Autism and anxiety

Everyone gets anxiety in their life, what studies measure its interaction with ASD? Is anxiety more prevalent in ASD? 

<!-- more -->
An estimated 4.05% of the global population has an anxiety disorder, translating to 301 million people [(study)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s43045-023-00315-3). 

In the UK, 7.5% are diagnosed with GAD and around 1 in 6 meet the criteria for a common mental disorder [(NHS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/adult-psychiatric-morbidity-survey/survey-of-mental-health-and-wellbeing-england-2023-24/common-mental-health-conditions)

Autism has a higher rate [10.1017/S0033291718002283](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30178724/):

> *Lifetime prevalence for adults with ASD were 27% and 42% for any anxiety disorder, and 23% and 37% for depressive disorder"* 

*(lifetime prevalence being the proportion of a population that has experienced a specific health condition, behaviour, or risk factor)* 

Note: the DSM definition for GAD is

> Excessive anxiety and worry occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities

So the anxiety is difficult to control, and there is restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance.

### Other mental health issues

And from [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31447415/) about mental health diagnoses co-occurring with ASD:
