# Passive Aggressive Behaviour & PAPD

"Passive aggressive" was first used clinically during World War II to describe soldiers who refused to comply with officers’ demands *(Millon, 1981, cited in Hopwood CJ, Wright AG. 2012)*.  

Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder (PAPD) was a disorder in the DSM up until version IV, with its removal questioned.

- 1940s: William Menninger described passive-aggression in military contexts
- 1974: George Bach identified five types of passive-aggressive behaviours (below)
- 1952-1994: PAPD was in the DSM (moved to the appendix in DSM IV, removed in DSM-5/2013).

**DSM-III-R PAPD Criteria** (from the above paper):

> - Procrastination.
> - Getting irritable rather than openly refusing requests.
> - Screwing things up for people they resent.
> - Resenting demands outside their perceived job role.
> - Forgetfulness about things they don't want to do.
> - Feeling unappreciated for hard work.
> - Resenting suggestions for improvement.
> - Believing they do a better job than supervisors think.
> - Criticising people in authority.

As you might be able to tell, the intent for a couple of the above would be the the difference between the behaviour being passive aggressive and something else.

Should PAPD have been removed from the DSM? Quite a few studies don't think so. 

- [The Construct Validity of Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder (2010)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2862968/)
    - *"Results suggest that the construct is unidimensional, internally consistent, and reasonably stable"*
    - **"PAPD appears systematically related to borderline and narcissistic personality disorders, sets of personality traits, and childhood experiences"**
- [A psychometric study of DSM-IV passive-aggressive (negativistic) personality disorder criteria (2011)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10746207/)
    - *"DSM-IV PAPD is a unidimensional construct with adequate internal consistency (K-R 20 = .85)"*
    - [Passive-aggressive personality disorder: the demise of a syndrome (2016)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10224623/)
    - *"PAPD is no less valid than other personality disorders"*
- [The Construct Validity of Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder](https://www.academia.edu/33739668/The_Construct_Validity_of_Passive_Aggressive_Personality_Disorder)
    - *"Research indicates a heritability estimate of .50 for PAPD... internal consistency of PAPD was measured at .69 suggesting adequate reliability"*

*Construct validity - whether the construct or concept, task really does measure what it is claiming to measure.*

There are also studies arguing for less consistency in PAPD. One of the core reasons for its removal was the idea passive aggressiveness is situational, not a personality trait.

### 5 types of passive aggressive behaviour
In 1974, clinical psychologist George Bach categorised passive aggressive behaviour into 5 types in The Art of Assertive Living (1974):

#### 1. Pseudoaccommodators
Pretend to agree or accommodate to others' needs while secretly planning not to follow through.  

Example: Saying "Sure, I'll do that!" but having no intention of actually doing it.

#### 2. Guiltmakers
Intentionally make others feel guilty or responsible for hardship.  
Agreeing to do something but then making the other person feel responsible for any burden: "Well, I did it, but now I'm exhausted and my back hurts".

#### 3. Jokers
Use humor as a disguise to say hurtful things.  

Examples: making cutting remarks dressed up as jokes, then claiming "I was just kidding!" when confronted, singing provactive song lyrics then acting like it's "just a song I like".

#### 4. Trivial Tyrannizers (Subtle Saboteurs)
Intentionally do small things to annoy others.    

Examples: leaving dishes in the sink, "forgetting" important dates, being chronically late.

#### 5. Withholders
Punish others by withholding something valuable (affection, information, cooperation, approval).  

Examples: silent treatment, refusing to share important information, emotional withdrawal.


Signe Whitson (co-author of *The Angry Smile*) describes five levels of escalating passive aggression:

#### Level 1: Temporary Compliance
- Verbally agrees but behaviorally delays
- Example: "I'm coming!" (but never actually comes)

#### Level 2: Intentional Inefficiency
- Complies but does it poorly/incorrectly on purpose
- Does the task "wrong" so they won't be asked again

#### Level 3: Letting a Problem Escalate
- Uses inaction to allow foreseeable problems to worsen
- Takes pleasure in the resulting distress

#### Level 4: Hidden but Conscious Revenge
- Deliberately sabotages or undermines
- More calculated and vindictive

#### Level 5: Self-Deprecation
- Uses apparent self-punishment to manipulate others
- "I'm so worthless, I can't do anything right" (to avoid responsibility)
