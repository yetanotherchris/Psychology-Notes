#### Repetition Compulsion
Coined by Freud. Repeating destructive and self destructive behaviour patterns, and you can't help it. Picking the wrong mate, managing relationship that guarantees failure. It's a form of resistance, a defence mechanism.

#### Freud: Super Ego, Ego, ID
- **ID**: The primitive and instinctual part of the mind that contains sexual and aggressive drives and hidden memories. It operates on the pleasure principle, seeking immediate gratification.
- **Ego**: The realistic part that mediates between the desires of the ID and the Super Ego. It operates on the reality principle, finding socially acceptable ways to satisfy the ID's desires.
- **Super Ego**: The moral conscience of the mind, which includes the internalized standards and ideals we acquire from parents and society. It strives for perfection and judges the actions of the ego, leading to feelings of pride or guilt.

#### Freud's Pleasure Principle
Freud's Pleasure Principle is a concept in psychoanalytic theory that describes the instinctual drive to seek immediate gratification of needs, desires, and urges, particularly in the context of avoiding pain and seeking pleasure. According to Freud, this principle governs the behavior of the id, the unconscious part of the psyche.

#### Reality Principle
A concept from psychoanalytic theory introduced by Sigmund Freud, referring to the ability of the mind to assess the external world and act accordingly, delaying gratification of immediate desires in favor of long-term benefits. It contrasts with the "pleasure principle," which seeks immediate fulfillment of desires without regard for consequences.
