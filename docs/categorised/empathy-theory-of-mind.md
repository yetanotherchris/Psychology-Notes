# Empathy & Theory of Mind

#### Theory of Double Empathy
Simply put, the theory of the double empathy problem suggests that when people with very different experiences of the world interact with one another, they will struggle to empathise with each other. This is likely to be exacerbated through differences in language use and comprehension.

#### Cognitive Empathy
Putting yourself in another person's shoes (intellectually). Narcissists can improve this with therapy. They have structural differences in their nervous system, so they are not capable of developing true emotion. So they fake it. One moment they're concerned - next they're cold and distant. They want to appear normal.

Contemporary researchers often differentiate between two types of empathy: "Affective empathy" refers to the sensations and feelings we get in response to others' emotions; this can include mirroring what that person is feeling, or just feeling stressed when we detect another's fear or anxiety.

Attentiveness: eye contact, nod while you're talking. But as the relationship goes on they show no empathy for your concerns. Data mining your empathy - lots of interest in you? No that didn't happen.

#### Emotional Empathy
Genuinely feeling the emotion of the other person. How to tell the difference: consistency. Genuine understanding, even when it's inconvenient. It turns on and off with a Narcissist.

Caveat: if someone is always playing the victim when you try to help them, you feel less empathetic (because you feel like you're being used).

#### Borderline Empathy Paradox
The borderline empathy paradox is a model that suggests that people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) may have enhanced empathy despite impaired social functioning.

#### Systemizing Type Brain
Difference scores can also be used to categorize individuals into 'brain types.' Type S individuals have greater systemizing abilities relative to empathizing abilities. ASD has systemizing.
