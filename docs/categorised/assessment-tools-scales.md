#### 10-item Ruminative Response Scale (RRS)

#### State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)
The STAI is a psychological assessment tool used to measure two types of anxiety: state anxiety (temporary, situation-specific anxiety) and trait anxiety (general, long-term anxiety). The inventory helps differentiate between these two forms, providing insight into a person's overall anxiety level and how they react to stress-inducing situations.

#### Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)
The PSS-10 is a widely used psychological instrument that measures the perception of stress. It consists of 10 questions designed to assess how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale is often used to understand how individuals perceive their stress levels in various situations.

#### The Six Basic Emotions
