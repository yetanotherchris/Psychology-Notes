# Psychopathy & Antisocial Behavior

#### WEB and Psychopaths
In the context of dealing with psychopathic people, the acronym WEB stands for:
- Words
- Emotions
- Behaviour

This framework helps individuals understand and manage their interactions with psychopathic individuals by focusing on these three key aspects:

1. Words: Psychopaths often use manipulative language to deceive and control others. It's important to pay attention to what is being said and to question the truth and intentions behind their words
2. Emotions: Psychopaths can be skilled at manipulating emotions to exploit others. Being aware of how they might be trying to influence your emotional state can help you maintain control and avoid being manipulated
3. Behaviour: Observing their actions can provide insight into their true intentions. Consistent patterns of harmful or deceitful behaviour are strong indicators of psychopathic tendencies

#### Psychopathy and the Triarchic Model
The triarchic model proposes that psychopathy as described historically and represented in differing assessment devices encompasses three distinct but intersecting symptomatic (phenotypic) constructs: disinhibition, boldness, and meanness.

[Triarchic model research paper](https://patrickcnslab.psy.fsu.edu/wiki/images/6/62/PatDris2015.pdf)

#### Disinhibition
Entails impulsiveness, weak restraint, hostility and mistrust, and difficulties in regulating emotion.

#### Meanness
Entails deficient empathy, lack of affiliative capacity, contempt toward others, predatory exploitativeness, and empowerment through cruelty or destructiveness.

#### Boldness
The third construct in the triarchic model, boldness, entails proclivities toward confidence and social assertiveness, emotional resiliency, and venturesomeness.
