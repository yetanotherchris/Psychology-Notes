# Trauma & Attachment

#### Disorganised memories and IAMs
Disorganised memory is a symptom of trauma and PTSD, where memories aren't "assembled" in the right order but appear randomly for the victim and can appear as if they occurred recently. Research suggests that this is to do with emotions and hippocampus at the time (TODO).

#### Vicarious Trauma
Vicarious trauma, first developed by McCann and Pearlman (Branson, D. C., 2019), relates to compassion fatigue and workers (nurses, counsellors etc.) who experience trauma from interactions with trauma victims.

#### Intergenerational Trauma
Intergenerational trauma occurs when the impacts of trauma are passed from one generation to the next. Trauma can shape thoughts, feelings, and behaviour, thus affecting how individuals parent and communicate with their children.

#### Intrusion Trauma
Intrusion trauma is a core symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and can include unwanted and upsetting memories, nightmares, flashbacks, and emotional distress.

#### PTSD Night Terrors
Night terrors, also known as sleep terrors, are a sleep disturbance that can be a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults.

#### Anaclitic Depression
Anaclitic depression is a term introduced by René Spitz to describe a type of depression that occurs in infants who have been separated from their primary caregiver, typically the mother. It is characterized by withdrawal, crying, and refusal to eat, resulting from the loss of emotional connection and care.

#### Introjective Depression
Introjective depression is a form of depression where the individual experiences intense self-criticism, guilt, and feelings of worthlessness. It is often associated with a preoccupation with achieving perfection and an excessive focus on failure or inadequacy, leading to a deep sense of shame.

#### Adult Attachment Interview

The AAI, developed by Mary Main, consists of an interview that looks at the narratives they tell of their childhood, not the experiences themselves. Categories are Autonomous / Secure, Dismissing (downplaying), Preoccupied (overwhelmed), Unresolved (truama), Cannot Classify, Hostile (of their caregivers).


#### Adult Attachment Interview and PTSD
The (U)nresolved category of the AAI gives indications of PTSD, or potential PTSD risk. Not about the trauma but how it's mentally organised. People with U often have a history of trauma, and show signs of PTSD: dissociation, intrusions, unprocessed affect.
