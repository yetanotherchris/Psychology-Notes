# Psychoanalytic Theory - Jung

#### Jung: Individuation
Individuation is a key concept in Carl Jung's analytical psychology, referring to the process of becoming one's true self. It involves integrating various aspects of the psyche, such as the conscious and unconscious mind, to achieve personal wholeness and self-realization. This process helps individuals develop a unique identity separate from societal roles and collective unconscious influences.

#### Jung: Shadow Projection
Shadow projection is a concept from Jungian psychology, where an individual projects their unconscious, often negative or undesirable, traits (the "shadow") onto others. Instead of recognizing these traits within themselves, people see them in others, which can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and bias.

#### Jung: Persona
The persona is the social mask or facade that an individual presents to the world. According to Jung, it represents the roles we play in society and the way we want others to perceive us. While necessary for social interaction, over-identifying with the persona can lead to losing touch with one's true self.

#### Psychological Complex
A psychological complex is a group of related, often repressed, thoughts, feelings, and memories that influence an individual's behavior and perception. Originating in Jungian psychology, complexes are usually organized around a common theme (e.g., a power complex or an inferiority complex) and can strongly impact an individual's emotions and actions, often without conscious awareness.
