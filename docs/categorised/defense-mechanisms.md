# Defense Mechanisms

#### Projective Identification
In psychoanalysis, projective identification is a defense mechanism in which the individual projects qualities that are unacceptable to the self onto another person, and that person introjects the projected qualities and believes him/herself to be characterized by them appropriately and justifiably.

Often used by parents, repeating their own childhood traumas.

#### Displacement
Displacement is a defense mechanism in psychology where a person unconsciously redirects negative emotions or feelings from their original source to a less threatening person or object.

For example, someone who is angry at their boss might take their anger out on a family member.
