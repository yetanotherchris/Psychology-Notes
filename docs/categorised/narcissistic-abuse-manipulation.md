# Narcissistic Abuse & Manipulation

#### JADE
Don't:
- Justify
- Argue
- Defend
- Explain

yourself with difficult family members.

#### DARVO
They will do this when confronted about wrong doing:
- **Defend**, then they
- **Attack**, then they paint themselves as
- **Reverse victim**, casting you as the
- **Offender**

#### Emotional Delay
Delayed response to someone upsetting you.

#### Apology Substitutes
Instead of apologising, a narcissistic person buys a gift for you a day or so later, or bakes a cake.

#### Child of Narcissist Parents and Depersonalization/Dissociative
The 6 most common signs of a depersonalization disorder are:
1. A feeling of no connection to the person that is seen in a mirror
2. A feeling of detachment from one's environment - the feeling is a disconnection from the world, but also an unfamiliarity with individuals and inanimate objects and all surroundings
3. A feeling of being "robot like"
4. A complete separation feeling from one's body, as if wound up in cotton and the body is lifeless
5. A feeling that one's memories belong to someone else
6. Knowing that you are not delusional, but that there is something wrong with the way you view the world
