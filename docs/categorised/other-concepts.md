#### How Long Does it Actually Take to Form a New Habit?
Phillippa Lally is a health psychology researcher at University College London. In a study published in the European Journal of Social Psychology, Lally and her research team decided to figure out just how long it actually takes to form a habit.

On average, it takes more than 2 months before a new behaviour becomes automatic - 66 days to be exact.

You have to repeat something 7 times for it to sink in.

#### The Zeigarnik Effect
The Zeigarnik Effect is a psychological phenomenon where people tend to remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. Named after Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, who watched waitresses in cafes in the 1920s, it suggests that the tension created by an incomplete task keeps it active in memory, leading to a stronger recall.

This effect highlights the human mind's propensity to prioritize unfinished tasks, possibly to encourage their completion, and has implications in various fields, including motivation, memory retention, and productivity.

#### Mental Rehearsal
A cognitive technique where an individual visualizes or mentally practices a task or activity without physically performing it.

#### Rat Heaven
The term "Rat Heaven" typically refers to an experimental setup used in studies of addiction.

In the alternative rat heaven setup (where the rats aren't isolated), the rats were placed in a much larger, more stimulating environment with access to food, water, toys, and social interaction with other rats. In this enriched environment, the rats were also given access to drugs. However, unlike the isolated rats, those in the "Rat Park" environment showed far less interest in the drugs, often choosing to avoid them or use them only occasionally.

#### Pareto Distribution

#### Festaiolo

#### Relational Schema Psychology
Relational schema psychology refers to cognitive structures that represent patterns of interpersonal relationships. These schemas guide expectations and behavior in social interactions, influencing how individuals perceive and respond to others based on past relational experiences.

#### Cognitive Science and Consciousness
Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field that studies the mind, intelligence, and behavior from multiple perspectives, including psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, philosophy, and linguistics. Consciousness within cognitive science refers to the state of being aware of and able to think about one's own thoughts, feelings, and environment.

#### Overdetermination
In psychology, overdetermination is the idea that a psychological experience has multiple, independent, and concurrent causes. It can be observed in conscious thoughts and experiences.

Overdetermination occurs when a single-observed effect is determined by multiple causes, any one of which alone would be conceivably sufficient to account for ("determine") the effect.

#### Loaded Question (Assumes the Statement is True)
Assumes something is true without proof, embedding an unverified claim. Often emotionally charged to influence the respondent.

Example: "Why did you waste all that money?" (Assumes money was wasted.)

#### Leading Question (Encourages Agreement)
Guides the respondent toward a specific answer, often subtly. Suggests the desired response through wording or context.

Example: "Don't you think this plan is great?" (Encourages agreement.)
