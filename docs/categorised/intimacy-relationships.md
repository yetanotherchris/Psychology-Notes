# Intimacy & Relationships

#### Intimacy
There are three types of intimacy:
- Emotional intimacy: a deep feeling of closeness and trust
- Physical intimacy: includes touching in a way that enhances feelings of closeness and desire
- Sexual intimacy: combines the physical act of sex with emotional closeness and trust

#### Self-Object Transference
Self-object transference refers to the idea that an individual can introject by transference another person's self-regulation and emotional stability – and then use this to self-soothe at times when that other person is not available.

#### Transference and Countertransference
Transference is the redirection of feelings about a specific person onto someone else (in therapy, this refers to a client's projection of their feelings about someone else onto their therapist). Countertransference is the redirection of a therapist's feelings toward the client.

Another definition is: the patient's reactions or unhelpful reactions to therapist.

The three main types of transference typically discussed are positive, negative, and erotic or sexual transference. Erotic transference refers to feelings of romantic or sexual attraction that a client may develop toward their therapist.

#### Soothing Mirroring
Soothing mirroring is a concept in psychotherapy where a therapist or caregiver reflects a person's emotions and experiences back to them in a calming and validating manner. This mirroring helps the individual feel understood and supported, which can be particularly healing in therapeutic settings.

#### Mature Dependence
Mature dependence refers to a healthy form of interdependence in relationships where individuals rely on others for support and care without losing their sense of autonomy or identity. It contrasts with unhealthy dependency, where one becomes overly reliant on others to the detriment of their own well-being.

#### Silent Treatment
A form of ostracizing, including one word answers, looking away and so on. It does tremendous damage in relationships, and is a hard pattern to break.
