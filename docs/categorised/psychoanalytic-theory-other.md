# Psychoanalytic Theory - Other

## Borderline Personality Organisation

#### Kohut's Tragic Man + Imago
Heinz Kohut, a psychoanalyst, developed the concept of the "tragic man" as part of his self-psychology theory. This concept suggests that individuals are inherently flawed due to their vulnerabilities and inevitable disappointments in life. The "imago" refers to an idealized image of self or others, which often contrasts with reality and can lead to narcissistic injuries.

#### Kohut Mirroring
Heinz Kohut introduced the concept of mirroring as part of his Self Psychology theory. Mirroring refers to the process by which parents (or others) reflect back a child's feelings, thoughts, and actions, validating their experience and helping to build a healthy sense of self. A lack of adequate mirroring can lead to issues with self-esteem and identity.

## Object Relations Theory

#### Imago
An unconscious idealized mental image of someone, especially a parent, which influences a person's behaviour. An imago of your dad.

The imago is typically formed in infancy and childhood and is generally an idealized or otherwise not completely accurate representation.

#### Object Relations Dyad
In object relations theory, a dyad refers to a two-person relationship, typically between an infant and a caregiver. This dyadic relationship is crucial for the development of the individual's internal world and their understanding of relationships. The interactions within this dyad form the foundation for how the individual relates to others later in life.

#### Object Relations Theory
Object Relations Theory is a psychoanalytic theory that focuses on the relationships people have with others (referred to as "objects," in this context, usually meaning people) and how these relationships influence the development of the self. Early interactions with primary caregivers are considered crucial, shaping how individuals relate to others and themselves throughout life.

#### Object Constancy in Childhood and Its Relationship
Object constancy, a concept from object relations theory, is a child's ability to maintain an emotional bond with a caregiver even when they are absent. Difficulty developing object constancy can lead to issues with attachment, trust, and emotional regulation.

## Other Psychoanalytic Theorists

#### Dead Mother Complex (André Green)
Introduced by psychoanalyst André Green, the Dead Mother Complex describes a psychological state in which an individual, usually a child, experiences emotional abandonment by a primary caregiver, often the mother. The "dead mother" is not physically dead but is emotionally unavailable, leading to profound feelings of loss, emptiness, and a struggle to connect with others later in life.

#### Alfred Adler: Inferiority Complex
Alfred Adler introduced the concept of the inferiority complex, which refers to a deep feeling of inadequacy and insecurity that arises from perceived physical or psychological deficiencies. This complex often drives individuals to overcompensate by striving for superiority and success.

#### Separation-Individuation and Child Rapprochement Phase
Margaret Mahler's theory describes the separation-individuation process, where a child develops a distinct sense of self. The rapprochement phase occurs around 15-24 months, when a child alternates between seeking independence and reassurance from a caregiver, reflecting a tension between autonomy and dependency.
