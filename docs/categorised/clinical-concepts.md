# Clinical Concepts

#### Vignettes
Case studies. A vignette should express a certain moment, mood, aspect, setting, character, or object. Most of all, it should be short, but descriptive. In terms of length, a vignette is typically 800-1000 words.

#### Pathological
Refers to behaviors, thoughts, or emotions that are maladaptive, extreme, or indicative of a mental disorder. Pathological conditions deviate significantly from typical or healthy functioning, often requiring intervention or treatment.

#### Pathology
Pathology in psychology refers to the study of psychological disorders and maladaptive behaviors. It involves understanding the causes, development, and effects of mental illnesses or behavioral dysfunctions. Psychological pathology focuses on identifying symptoms and understanding the mechanisms that lead to mental health issues.

#### Reality Testing
The psychological process by which an individual distinguishes between the internal world (thoughts, feelings, fantasies) and the external world (objective reality). Effective reality testing is crucial for healthy psychological functioning and is impaired in conditions like psychosis.

#### Microexpressions
Brief, involuntary facial expressions that reveal true emotions, often occurring in a fraction of a second. Microexpressions are difficult to fake and are used in psychological research and lie detection to understand underlying emotions.

#### Delusions
What evidence could change your mind about a delusion? If they say nothing it's pathological. And if the evidence is impossible to get. Consider the evidence.

#### Hostile Superego
The superego, in Freudian psychoanalysis, is the part of the psyche that internalizes societal rules and morals. A "hostile superego" is when this internalized moral authority becomes overly harsh or punitive, leading to excessive guilt, self-criticism, and sometimes destructive behaviors.

#### Autoeroticism
Refers to sexual arousal or gratification derived from one's own body without external stimulation, commonly through self-stimulation or fantasy. This concept was explored in depth by Sigmund Freud, particularly in the context of early childhood development.
