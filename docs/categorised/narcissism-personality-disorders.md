# Narcissism & Personality Disorders

#### Dichotomous Thinking
Black and white thinking. Good or bad, perfect or useless. Acting impulsively based on how you see someone. Also known as "black or white thinking". When people engage in dichotomous thinking, they see things in extremes - it's all or nothing; black or white; this or that. Use absolute language like "always" and "never" to describe things. Shifting between seeing things as good or bad.

#### Referential Ideation
The narcissist faces a stark choice - either be (or become) the permanent centre of the world, or cease to be altogether. This constant obsession with one's locus, with one's centrality, with one's position as a hub - leads to referential ideation ("ideas of reference"). Everything is about or against me.

#### Attentional Narrowing
Applies to pathological narcissism - if you have witnessed it, you will have seen pathological narcissism. The end goal is as rewarding as the process. So the narcissist finds chasing supply as rewarding, elevating as getting it.

#### Theodore Millon, Personality Disorders and Narcissism Traits
NPD is a disorder because it's dysfunctional as there are negative outcomes to the person with NPD. Disorder can't work in teams etc but traits they can.

#### Identity Diffusion
Identity diffusion is a state of not developing or possessing a distinct identity. Often, this is a result of a young person not yet developing a firm identity, or their identity has come to a state of crisis, and they haven't committed to a resolution.

#### Negative Identity Formation
Negative identity is an identity that is formed by identifying with roles opposed to societal expectations.

#### Ego Syntonic
Thoughts and behaviours that are inline with values. No guilt. Consistent self-image.

In personality disorders, many traits are often ego-syntonic, making individuals less likely to recognize their behaviours as dysfunctional or seek help. For instance, someone with narcissistic personality disorder might see their entitlement or need for admiration as justified rather than problematic.

e.g. psychopath acts in an ego syntonic way when being cruel.

#### Ego Dystonic
Thoughts and behaviours that aren't inline with values. Intrusive thoughts or unwelcome thoughts. Can include a desire to change.

Many people have ego-dystonic thoughts, but immediately recognize them as untrue, and move on with their day.

Disorders like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) - not a personality disorder but often confused as one - are typically ego-dystonic, as individuals with OCD recognize their intrusive thoughts and compulsions as irrational yet feel unable to stop them.

#### Childhood Narcissism Scale
The Childhood Narcissism Scale (CNS) is a psychological assessment tool designed to measure narcissistic traits in children. It assesses self-centeredness, a sense of superiority, entitlement, and a lack of empathy, which are characteristics of narcissistic behavior observed in childhood.

#### Herbert Rosenfeld Narcissism
Herbert Rosenfeld was a psychoanalyst known for his work on narcissism. He focused on how internalized objects (representations of others) contribute to the development of narcissistic defenses, which protect the self from feelings of vulnerability or annihilation.

#### Herbert Rosenfeld: Thick Skin and Thin Skin Narcissist
Rosenfeld distinguished between thick-skinned narcissists, who appear invulnerable and dismissive of others, and thin-skinned narcissists, who are hypersensitive to criticism and prone to feelings of humiliation. Both forms represent defenses against underlying fragility.

#### Dark Triad
The Dark Triad is a term used to describe three personality traits that are considered malevolent: narcissism (excessive self-love and a sense of superiority), Machiavellianism (manipulative and deceitful behavior), and psychopathy (lack of empathy and antisocial behavior). These traits are often studied together due to their overlapping characteristics and their potential for causing harm in social and organizational contexts.

#### Dark Tetrad
The Dark Tetrad expands on the Dark Triad by adding a fourth trait: sadism (enjoyment of others' suffering). This addition emphasizes the more aggressive and harmful behaviors that can arise when these traits are present together, providing a more comprehensive understanding of toxic personality profiles.
