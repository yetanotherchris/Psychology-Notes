#### Intermittent Reinforcement
**Short description:**
Intermittent reinforcement is when a behaviour isn't rewarded every time, but only sometimes, and this makes the behaviour much harder to stop. In behaviourism, it's a type of operant conditioning where the unpredictability of the reward (like a slot machine paying out occasionally) strengthens the habit more than constant rewards would.

Because the person or animal never knows when the next "win" will come, they keep repeating the behaviour, hoping for that next reward - this is why gambling, social media likes, or even texting someone who replies inconsistently can become so addictive.

**Long description:**
Intermittent reinforcement is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when rewards or punishments are delivered inconsistently and unpredictably. This can create a powerful motivational force that keeps individuals engaged in a behaviour, even if the rewards are infrequent.

In the context of a narcissistic relationship, intermittent reinforcement is often used by the narcissist as a manipulative tactic to keep their partner emotionally invested in the relationship. By alternating between giving affection, attention, and validation, and withholding those things, the narcissist creates an environment where their partner is constantly on edge, seeking their approval and attention.

Because the rewards are unpredictable, the partner becomes increasingly fixated on seeking the narcissist's attention and validation, which can lead to an unhealthy and co-dependent relationship. The narcissist may also use intermittent reinforcement to keep their partner in a state of emotional turmoil, as they become addicted to the highs and lows of the relationship.

Ultimately, the use of intermittent reinforcement by a narcissist is a tool for maintaining control and power over their partner. By keeping their partner emotionally invested and dependent on their approval, the narcissist can continue to manipulate and exploit them for their own gain.

#### Approach Avoidance Compulsion
I depend on you, I hate being dependent on you and withdraw. He resents his dependence on the supply. He's afraid of losing them so placates them.

#### External Locus of Control
High external locus of control - blame others. Low: blame self and acknowledging external factors.

#### Impulsivity
In psychology, impulsivity (or impulsiveness) is a tendency to act on a whim, displaying behavior characterized by little or no forethought, reflection, or consideration of the consequences.

#### Coercion Theory and Coercive Cycle (Gerald Patterson)
Coercion Theory, developed by Gerald Patterson, describes a pattern of negative interactions often seen in families where coercive behaviors (such as whining, nagging, or aggression) are used to control others. The "coercive cycle" refers to the escalating exchange of such behaviors between parent and child, where each party inadvertently reinforces the other's negative behavior, leading to a vicious cycle of conflict.
