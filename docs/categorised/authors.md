> "It is so much easier for traumatized patients to talk about what has been done to them - to tell a story of victimization and revenge - than to notice, feel, and put into words the reality of their internal experience"
— Bessel van der Kolk, The Body Keeps the Score

> I'll add it's often fairly easy to tell who has benefited from meaningful psychotherapy and who has not. Those caught in what vdK calls the "story of victimization and revenge" have not. Those able to reflect on their experience in more complex and nuanced ways, in the context of a larger integrated narrative of the arc of their lives, have.

#### André Green - Dead Mother Complex
Introduced by psychoanalyst André Green, the Dead Mother Complex describes a psychological state in which an individual, usually a child, experiences emotional abandonment by a primary caregiver, often the mother. The "dead mother" is not physically dead but is emotionally unavailable, leading to profound feelings of loss, emptiness, and a struggle to connect with others later in life.

#### Kohut Mirroring
Heinz Kohut introduced the concept of mirroring as part of his Self Psychology theory. Mirroring refers to the process by which parents (or others) reflect back a child's feelings, thoughts, and actions, validating their experience and helping to build a healthy sense of self. A lack of adequate mirroring can lead to issues with self-esteem and identity.

#### Kohut's Tragic Man + Imago
Heinz Kohut, a psychoanalyst, developed the concept of the "tragic man" as part of his self-psychology theory. This concept suggests that individuals are inherently flawed due to their vulnerabilities and inevitable disappointments in life. The "imago" refers to an idealized image of self or others, which often contrasts with reality and can lead to narcissistic injuries.
