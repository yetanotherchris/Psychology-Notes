#### Dissociation & Dissociative
Dissociation refers to a mental process where a person disconnects from their thoughts, feelings, memories, or sense of identity. Dissociative experiences can range from mild detachment from immediate surroundings to more severe forms, such as dissociative disorders, which involve a significant disruption in normal consciousness, identity, memory, or awareness.

#### Mood Congruent
This term describes emotions, thoughts, or behaviors that are consistent with the current mood of the individual. For example, a person in a depressive state might have mood-congruent thoughts of sadness or worthlessness.

#### Mood Incongruent
Opposite to mood congruent, mood incongruent refers to thoughts, emotions, or behaviors that are not consistent with the person's current mood. An example might be a person experiencing depressive symptoms but having grandiose thoughts, which are typically associated with mania.

Somatization is the psychological phenomenon where emotional distress or psychological conflict is expressed through physical symptoms. These symptoms cannot be fully explained by a medical condition and often include pain, gastrointestinal issues, or neurological problems.

Unlike amentia, dementia usually occurs later in life and involves the deterioration of previously acquired cognitive abilities
