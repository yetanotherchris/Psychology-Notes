#### BDNF - Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor
A Neurotrophin. Higher levels of the protein are associated with improved cognitive functioning, mental health, and short- and long-term memory. Rigorous exercise has been shown to increase BDNF levels.

#### BDNF Dopamine
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a protein that regulates many functions in the central nervous system (CNS), including neuronal survival, migration, and synapse formation.

BDNF has been shown to influence the release of dopamine in the mesolimbic dopamine system.

#### Reduced Frontal Lobe Function with Alcohol
Alcohol can make it difficult for people to control their emotions and impulses because it affects the frontal lobes of the brain. The frontal lobes are responsible for abstract thinking, planning, problem solving, and emotions.

#### 4 Core Executive Functions of the Brain
The four core executive functions are:
1. Working Memory: The ability to hold and manipulate information in mind over short periods
2. Cognitive Flexibility: The capacity to switch between thinking about different concepts or to adapt behavior in response to changing circumstances
3. Inhibitory Control: The ability to suppress inappropriate or unwanted behaviors or thoughts, including self-control and attentional control
4. Planning and Organization: The ability to set goals, develop strategies, and manage time and resources to achieve objectives

#### Left Brain vs Right Brain
This concept refers to the idea that the two hemispheres of the brain are responsible for different types of cognitive functions. The left brain is often associated with logical, analytical, and language-oriented tasks, while the right brain is linked to creativity, intuition, and spatial awareness. However, this dichotomy is an oversimplification, as both hemispheres work together in most cognitive processes.

#### Neurofeedback Training
Neurofeedback training is a type of biofeedback that uses real-time monitoring of brain activity, typically via EEG (electroencephalography), to teach individuals how to regulate their brain function. The goal is to help improve mental states, such as reducing anxiety or enhancing focus, by reinforcing desirable brainwave patterns.
