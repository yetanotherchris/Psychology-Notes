# Anxiety: research showing slow breathing reduces acute anxiety

There is a lot of research concluding that it's possible to lower stress and anxiety using breathwork (4-6 breaths/minute), as a daily practice.

<!-- more -->

Some of these studies are self-report, others measure cortisol before and after. One study reported daily breathwork, lowering your breaths to a target of 4-6 per minute seems to have a big effect on stress.

Study 1, which includes Andrew Huberman of the Huberman Podcast as one of its authors, has the best practical advice although it had a small sample size of 114.

- Sighing was most effective
- `1 : 0.25 : 2` breathing had the best results of the breathing

For example:

- 4 seconds deep in breath through the nose. 
- 1 second to "top up" breath to fill lungs.
- 8 seconds controlled sigh out through the mouth.

Do this 5 minutes per day, 28 days.
