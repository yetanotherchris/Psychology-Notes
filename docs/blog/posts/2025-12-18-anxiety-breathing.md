# Anxiety: research showing slow breathing reduces acute anxiety

There is a lot of research concluding that it's possible to lower stress and anxiety using breathwork (4-6 breaths/minute), as a daily practice.

Some of these studies are self-report, others measure cortisol before and after. The "Brief structured respiration..." study compared three daily 5-minute breathwork exercises with mindfulness meditation over one month. "Effect of breathwork.." found significantly lower stress levels.

So daily breathwork, lowering your breaths to a target of 4-6 per minute seems to have a big effect on stress (g = -0.35 in one study, 0.81). Both test between-group. Within-group was slightly lower.

One study had 484 participants in one study, 794 participants in another (medium effect in this one).
