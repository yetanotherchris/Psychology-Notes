# Passive Aggressive Behaviour

All the way back in 1974, clinical psychologist George Bach categorised passive aggressive behaviour into 5 types. Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder (PAPD) was a disorder in the DSM up until version IV, with its removal questioned.

A brief history of passive aggressive studies over 70 years:

- 1940s: William Menninger described passive-aggression in military contexts
- 1950s-1970s: Murray Bowen developed triangulation theory
- 1974: George Bach identified five types of passive-aggressive behaviors
- 1952-1994: Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder was in the DSM (removed in DSM-5 2013).

Should PAPD have been removed from the DSM? Quite a few studies don't think so. Construct validity is whether the construct or concept, task really does measure what it is claiming to measure.

- [The Construct Validity of Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder (2010)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2862968/)
  - *"Results suggest that the construct is unidimensional, internally consistent, and reasonably stable"*
  - **"PAPD appears systematically related to borderline and narcissistic personality disorders, sets of personality traits, and childhood experiences"**
- [A psychometric study of DSM-IV passive-aggressive (negativistic) personality disorder criteria (2011)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10746207/)
  - *"DSM-IV PAPD is a unidimensional construct with adequate internal consistency (K-R 20 = .85)"*
- [Passive-aggressive personality disorder: the demise of a syndrome (2016)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10224623/)
  - *"PAPD is no less valid than other personality disorders"*
- [The Construct Validity of Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder](https://www.academia.edu/33739668/The_Construct_Validity_of_Passive_Aggressive_Personality_Disorder)
  - *"Research indicates a heritability estimate of .50 for PAPD... internal consistency of PAPD was measured at .69 suggesting adequate reliability"*

There are studies arguing for less consistency in PAPD. One of the core reasons for its removal was the idea passive aggressiveness is situational, not a personality trait.

The five types George Bach described in Creative Aggression: The Art of Assertive Living (1974) were:

##### 1. Pseudoaccommodators
Pretend to agree or accommodate to others' needs while secretly planning not to follow through.
Example: Saying "Sure, I'll do that!" but having no intention of actually doing it.

##### 2. Guiltmakers
Intentionally make others feel guilty or responsible for hardship.  
Agreeing to do something but then making the other person feel responsible for any burden: "Well, I did it, but now I'm exhausted and my back hurts".

##### 3. Jokers
Use humor as a disguise to say hurtful things.
Examples: making cutting remarks dressed up as jokes, then claiming "I was just kidding!" when confronted, singing provactive song lyrics then acting like it's "just a song I like".

##### 4. Trivial Tyrannizers (Subtle Saboteurs)
Intentionally do small things to annoy others.  
Examples: leaving dishes in the sink, "forgetting" important dates, being chronically late.

##### 5. Withholders
Punish others by withholding something valuable (affection, information, cooperation, approval).  
Examples: silent treatment, refusing to share important information, emotional withdrawal.

Studies and research relating to passive aggressive behaviour:

- [Development and Validation of a Measure of Passive Aggression Traits: The Passive Aggression Scale (PAS)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9405400/)
- [Expression of Hostility - Basis of Passive Aggressive Behavior. Correlational Study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370481463_Expression_of_Hostility_-_Basis_of_Passive_Aggressive_Behavior_Correlational_Study)
- [Effect of passive aggressive behaviour on workplace incivitlity](/tools/llm-consensus-answers/workplace-incivility.html). Similar studies to the paper "When Workers Flout Convention: A Study of Workplace Incivility".

Signe Whitson (co-author of *The Angry Smile*) describes five levels of escalating passive aggression:

##### Level 1: Temporary Compliance
- Verbally agrees but behaviorally delays
- Example: "I'm coming!" (but never actually comes)

##### Level 2: Intentional Inefficiency
- Complies but does it poorly/incorrectly on purpose
- Does the task "wrong" so they won't be asked again

##### Level 3: Letting a Problem Escalate
- Uses inaction to allow foreseeable problems to worsen
- Takes pleasure in the resulting distress

##### Level 4: Hidden but Conscious Revenge
- Deliberately sabotages or undermines
- More calculated and vindictive

##### Level 5: Self-Deprecation
- Uses apparent self-punishment to manipulate others
- "I'm so worthless, I can't do anything right" (to avoid responsibility)
