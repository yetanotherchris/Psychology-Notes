# Worry vs Rumination

A short comparison of worry (anxiety) vs rumination.

<!-- more -->

### Worry
Worry is future-oriented anxious thinking, typically focused on potential threats or problems that might occur. What-if questions, and thinking-chains it is an intolerance of uncertainty and also avoiding emotions.

Worry is synonymous with anxiety and in excess is a key feature of [Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD)](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder-gad/)

### Rumination

Rumination is past-oriented repetitive thinking, characterised by dwelling on things that have already happened. For example why mistakes were made, perceived failures, or trying to understand why something occurred.

- Dwelling on negative events and thinking about them in detail.
- It prolongs negative feeling.
- Co-rumination which is more common in female social structures, can actually accentuate problems.
- "Reflective pondering" may serve analytical purposes: brooding (self-critical) vs reflection. [Treynor, W., Gonzalez, R., & Nolen-Hoeksema, S. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1023910315561)
- Rumination impairs problem-solving rather than enhancing it, interferes with instrumental behaviour, and prolongs negative mood states [Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Wisco, B. E., & Lyubomirsky, S. (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00088.x)
- [Reflecting on rumination: Consequences, causes, mechanisms and treatment of rumination](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2020.103573). Differentiates between "Why did this happen to me?" vs "What specifically went wrong and what steps could change it" in rumination.
