# Are personality disorders linked to personality traits?

Can personality disorders be seen as the extreme end of personality traits (the OCEAN model)?

<!-- more -->
Short answer: Yes. This is the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD).

> The DSM-5's AMPD represents a paradigm shift away from the traditional categorical model in favor of a dimensional approach in PD classification
>  
> Dimensional systems such as the AMPD were developed based on several important research findings: a) significant heterogeneity exists within specific PDs, such that two individuals who meet criteria for a given PD may have very different clinical presentations; b) there are high levels of comorbidity (and/or overlap) among purportedly distinct PDs

- An early study: [Personality Disorders and The Five-Factor Model of Personality](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/pedi.1990.4.4.362)
  - This study replicates an earlier study (IPC or circumplex model by Costa & McCrae, 1990) that suggests personality disorders aren't qualitatively different from normal personality - they can be understood as extreme or maladaptive variants of the same underlying traits.

Both use university students, but that has been replicated beyond university students: [A Meta-Analytic Review of the Relationships Between the Five-Factor Model and DSM-IV-TR Personality Disorders: A Facet Level Analysis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2614445/)

And looking at how personality changes from life events:

  - Marriage predicted a decrease in openness
  - Starting a new job predicted increases in people’s conscientiousness and emotional stability,
  - OCEAN changes were less pronounced than changes in life satisfaction
