# If you really cared, I wouldn't have to ask

Is there an attachment style associated with this type of belief? The belief that help only counts if it's offered spontaneously, and that having to ask for it invalidates or diminishes its value. Does it come from childhood, or in adult relationships (adult attachment) only?

Another description for this is an inverted bid for connection - avoiding making the bid because you believe genuine care should be intuitive, not requested. It's a test of attunement, and when it doesn't come, confirms the belief itself.

In therapy it is described as a fantasy of unconditional availability or magical thinking about care. It can however be a result of a lack of attunement by a partner - so the partner genuinely doesn't care (only when asked, on demand).

In attachment theory, secure attachment is recognised as:

- Asking for help is normal communication. It shouldn't be or need to be a test or sign of failure
- Others can't read minds, and it doesn't mean they don't care.
- But importantly - can distinguish between someone who cares but didn't notice vs. someone who is genuinely unavailable or neglectful
- Can accept help without feeling shame from it.
- Tend to ask for help more readily, seeing it as practical information exchange.

### Which type is silently waiting for help?
John Bowlby and then Mary Ainsworth (1978) described 3 types of childhood attachment styles in the 60s:

- Secure
- Insecure: avoidant. This is shown as not caring in the Strange Situation experiment.
- Insecure: anxious. This is shown as being pre-occupied when the carer is away, and angry when they return.

Main, M., & Solomon, J. (1986) added a 4th type, insecure: disorganised. This is a combination of both insecure ones, and is linked to mental health problems and particularly personality disorders. [Attachment style in ASD adults](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12353242/) is a meta study, and concludes ASD is comparable to the general public for insecure attachment.

Adult attachments styles, for romantic relationships, was described in Hazan, C., & Shaver, P. (1987). "Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 52(3), 511-524. They were the same a the childhood ones by Ainsworth.

There's another framework for adult attachment, by Bartholomew & Horowitz (1991):

- Secure
- Preoccupied (high anxiety, low avoidance)
- Dismissing-avoidant (low anxiety, high avoidance)
- Fearful-avoidant (high anxiety, high avoidance)

**But which type is the 'silently waiting for help' one?**  

Disregarding a neglectful parent or partner who isn't attuned to the child or partner's needs - for example shaming the partner for needing help - it would be anxious. It appears like avoidant also, so morphing from anxious to start with, moving to avoidant. Cycling between hope and disappointment, but staying engaged in the dynamic (when it's an adult attachment) rather than asking for help; and when no help arrives moving away from the relationship.
