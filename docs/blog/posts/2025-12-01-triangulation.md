##### Murray Bowen
Murray Bowen was a psychiatrist who developed Bowen Family Systems Theory in the 1950s-1970s, and with it triangulation. "Family Therapy in Clinical Practice" (1978).

He saw triangulation as when a two-person system under stress pulls in a third party to reduce anxiety.   **It can be healthy** (e.g., bringing in a therapist to mediate) or **unhealthy** (manipulative). The lower one's differentiation (maturity), the higher the tendency toward triangulation.

It occurs naturally when anxiety rises in a two-person relationship (dyad).

##### Jay Hayley
Jay Haley introduced "The Perverse Triangle" in 1967 and further defined it in his 1977 work, "Toward a Theory of Pathological Systems".
His example was a parent and child forming a coalition against the third person (the other parent). The existence of the coalition is denied by both.

##### Salvador Minuchin
Described a similar system to Jay Hayley, naming it the "Rigid Triad".

#### Karen L. Franck & Cheryl Buehler
The "Destabilizing Triangulation" was published in Journal of Family Psychology. 

They studied triangulation effects on children and adolescents and found that triangulated youth experience increased anxiety, self-blame, torn between parents.
