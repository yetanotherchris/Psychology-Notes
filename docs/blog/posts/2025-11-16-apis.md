# APIs and sites to search academic papers

There are quite a few alternatives to Google Scholar that are free. This is how the [The academic search](https://psychology-notes.yetanotherchris.dev/tools/academic-search/) on this site was built.

<!-- more -->

I've also added a few extra sites that have definitions and famous papers.

- [CrossRef.org API](https://api.crossref.org/swagger-ui/index.html). This searches academic papers and authors.
- [Semantic Scholar search](https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=%22D.%20Winnicott%22%20mirror&sort=relevance)
- [Citations API](https://citation.doi.org/api-docs.html)
- [APA's PsycInfo](https://www.apa.org/pubs/databases/psycinfo)
- [Classics in the History of Psychology](https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/author.htm)
