# OCEAN Traits and Personality Disorders: A Research Overview

## Introduction

The Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality, commonly known as the OCEAN model, has been extensively studied in relation to personality disorders. This research synthesis explores how specific facets of each OCEAN trait—Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism—are linked to various personality disorders.

## Neuroticism

Neuroticism is perhaps the most consistently implicated OCEAN trait in personality disorders.

- **Anxiety and Emotional Instability**: Strongly associated with Avoidant Personality Disorder and Dependent Personality Disorder ([Widiger & Costa, 2013](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1037/14343-006))
- **Anger/Hostility**: Linked to Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorders ([Samuel & Widiger, 2008](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1016/j.cpr.2008.07.002))
- **Depression**: Prominent in Avoidant and Dependent Personality Disorders ([Kotov et al., 2010](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1037/a0020327))
- **Self-consciousness**: Associated with Avoidant Personality Disorder ([Lynam & Widiger, 2001](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1037/0022-3514.81.2.322))
- **Impulsivity**: Central to Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorders ([Morey et al., 2016](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1037/abn0000145))

## Extraversion

Extraversion facets show significant relationships with several personality disorders:

- **Warmth (low)**: Associated with Schizoid and Schizotypal Personality Disorders ([Saulsman & Page, 2004](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1016/j.cpr.2004.06.001))

## Openness to Experience

Openness shows more complex relationships with personality disorders:

- **Fantasy (high)**: Associated with Schizotypal Personality Disorder ([Tackett et al., 2009](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1016/j.jrp.2008.12.006))

- **Actions (low)**: Related to rigid aspects of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder ([Samuel & Widiger, 2011](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1037/a0022471))
- **Ideas (unusual/magical)**: Central to Schizotypal Personality Disorder ([Piedmont et al., 2009](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2009.00583.x))

## Agreeableness

Agreeableness facets show strong correlations with several personality disorders:

- **Trust (low)**: Characteristic of Paranoid Personality Disorder ([Costa & McCrae, 2005](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1037/10519-139))
- **Straightforwardness (low)**: Associated with Antisocial and Narcissistic Personality Disorders ([Hopwood et al., 2009](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1521/pedi.2009.23.3.258))
- **Altruism (low)**: Present in Antisocial Personality Disorder ([Jones et al., 2011](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1037/a0021545))

- **Modesty (low)**: Central to Narcissistic Personality Disorder ([Gore & Widiger, 2013](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1037/a0030477))

## Conscientiousness

Conscientiousness facets demonstrate important links to personality disorders:

- **Competence (low)**: Associated with Dependent Personality Disorder ([Mullins-Sweatt & Widiger, 2010](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1080/00223891003670125))
- **Order (extremely high)**: Central to Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder ([Samuel & Widiger, 2010](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1037/a0019265))
- **Dutifulness (low)**: Linked to Antisocial Personality Disorder ([Lynam & Miller, 2019](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1016/j.paid.2019.02.030))
- **Achievement Striving (high)**: Characteristic of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder ([Haigler & Widiger, 2001](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1207/S15327752JPA7701_13))
- **Self-Discipline (low)**: Present in Borderline Personality Disorder ([Morey & Zanarini, 2000](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1176/appi.ajp.157.11.1783))
- **Deliberation (low)**: Associated with impulsive traits in Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorders ([Samuel & Widiger, 2004](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1016/j.jrp.2003.09.012))

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that personality disorders can be conceptualized as extreme and maladaptive variants of normal personality traits as described by the OCEAN model. Each personality disorder shows a characteristic pattern across multiple facets of the five major domains, underscoring the dimensional nature of personality pathology.
