Below is a literature review summarising research on the co‑morbidity of narcissistic and borderline personality traits (including antisocial personality disorder, ASPD) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention‑deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and other neurodiverse profiles. All references use Harvard “Cite it Right” style, and DOI links are constructed according to your specified format.

## 1. Introduction  
Co-occurrence of personality disorders (PDs) such as narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), borderline personality disorder (BPD), and ASPD with neurodevelopmental conditions like ASD and ADHD is drawing growing attention in psychiatry. Recent research suggests these overlaps are not rare and may reflect complex interactions between socio-cognitive deficits, affective dysregulation, and neurodevelopmental differences (Dow, 2020; Velikonja et al., 2019).

## 2. Narcissism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders  

Narcissistic traits, encompassing both grandiose and vulnerable dimensions, have been observed in clinical samples of individuals with ASD and ADHD. Vulnerable narcissism in particular has been associated with heightened interpersonal sensitivity and defensive self-regulation, which may intersect with the social-communication challenges of ASD (Ogawa et al., 2022). ADHD, on the other hand, shows stronger association with impulsivity-linked grandiose traits (Fossati et al., 2016).

Evidence indicates that certain ASD traits—particularly deficits in cognitive and affective empathy—can mimic or mask narcissistic features, making differential diagnosis challenging (Gillespie-Lynch et al., 2014). This overlap may result in diagnostic overshadowing, where neurodevelopmental symptoms are misinterpreted as personality pathology.

## 3. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Neurodiversity  

Research shows a notable comorbidity between BPD and ADHD, with estimates of ADHD prevalence among BPD patients ranging from 25–34% (Asherson et al., 2014). Emotional dysregulation and impulsivity are shared features, possibly underpinned by common neurobiological substrates. Similarly, autistic individuals—particularly women—are sometimes misdiagnosed with BPD due to overlapping features such as intense emotional reactions and relationship instability (Dell’Osso et al., 2018).

Some studies highlight the distinct developmental trajectories: in BPD, interpersonal instability is often linked to attachment disruption and trauma, while in ASD it arises from social cognition impairments (Rydén & Bejerot, 2008).

## 4. Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) Traits and Neurodiversity  

ASPD traits such as lack of remorse, impulsivity, and aggression have been studied in relation to ADHD, revealing a significantly increased risk of conduct disorder and, later, ASPD in those with childhood ADHD (Erskine et al., 2016). Co-occurrence of autistic traits with psychopathy (a construct overlapping with ASPD) has also been examined, particularly in forensic contexts. Some research suggests that while callous-unemotional traits are less common in ASD, overlap in behavioural manifestation can occur in subgroups (Gillberg et al., 2015).

## 5. Shared Mechanisms and Diagnostic Challenges  

Several mechanisms might underpin co-morbidity:  
- **Deficits in executive function** (common in ADHD, ASD) may exacerbate impulsivity seen in BPD or ASPD.  
- **Affective instability** may arise from both trauma-related dysregulation (BPD) and neurodevelopmental sensory/emotional processing differences (ASD).  
- **Social cognition impairments** in ASD may be confused with interpersonal exploitation seen in narcissism or ASPD.  

A dimensional, traits-based perspective—as in DSM-5 alternative model for PD—can better capture these overlaps.

---

## 6. Conclusion  

There is robust evidence for partial symptom overlap and co-occurrence between narcissistic, borderline, and antisocial personality pathologies with ADHD, ASD, and other neurodevelopmental conditions. Future research should focus on refining differential diagnosis strategies, considering both neurodevelopmental and personality dimensions.

If you’d like, I can **produce a detailed comparative table** mapping symptom overlaps, prevalence estimates, and neurocognitive correlates for each PD–neurodiversity comorbidity, which would make the clinical patterns much clearer.  
Would you like me to prepare that?
