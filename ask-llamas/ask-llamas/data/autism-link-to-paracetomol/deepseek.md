### Research on Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) Use During Pregnancy and Autism Risk  

Current research suggests a potential association between prenatal paracetamol exposure and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), though findings remain debated due to methodological limitations (e.g., confounding factors, recall bias). Below are key studies with synthesized conclusions and direct links to their DOIs:  

#### Key Studies Supporting an Association:

#### Meta-Analyses & Large Cohort Studies:  
4. **Ji et al. (2020)**  
   *Meta-analysis of 6 studies found prenatal acetaminophen use increased ASD risk (OR = 1.19).*

5. **Alemany et al. (2021)**  
   *Pooled data from 6 European cohorts showed dose-dependent ASD links (OR = 1.25 for "sometimes" use; OR = 1.70 for "persistent" use).*  
   European Journal of Epidemiology.  
   DOI: [10.1007/s10654-021-00754-4](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1007/s10654-021-00754-4)  

#### Studies Reporting Null or Conflicting Results:  
6. **Baker et al. (2021)**  
   *No association after adjusting for maternal indications (e.g., infection, fever).*  
   JAMA Psychiatry.  
   DOI: [10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.1599](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.1599)

   *No neurodevelopmental risks observed after sibling-matched analysis.*  
   International Journal of Epidemiology.  
   DOI: [10.1093/ije/dyw192](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1093/ije/dyw192)  

#### Mechanistic Research:  
8. **Bauer et al. (2021)**  
   *Proposed oxidative stress and endocrine disruption as biological pathways.*  
   Nature Reviews Endocrinology.  
   DOI: [10.1038/s41574-021-00553-7](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1038/s41574-021-00553-7)  

### Consensus Statements:  
- **Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (2021)** advises limiting prenatal acetaminophen to "lowest effective dose/duration" due to safety uncertainties[^9].  

---  
**Conclusion**: Evidence suggests a modest association between sustained prenatal acetaminophen use and ASD, but residual confounding (e.g., underlying maternal conditions) complicates causal inference. Rigorous prospective studies controlling for genetic/socioeconomic factors are needed.
