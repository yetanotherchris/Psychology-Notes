Certainly! Below is a list of **10 key behaviorist experiments**, **5 influential behaviorist authors**, and an overview of **modern behaviorist research since the 1990s**, including key concepts such as **positive/negative reinforcement** and **reinforcement schedules**.

### **5 Key Behaviorist Authors**  
1. **Ivan Pavlov** – Classical conditioning (Pavlov, 1927, *Conditioned Reflexes*)  
2. **B.F. Skinner** – Operant conditioning (Skinner, 1938, *The Behavior of Organisms*)  
3. **John B. Watson** – Foundational behaviorism (Watson, 1913, *Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It*)  
4. **Edward Thorndike** – Law of Effect (Thorndike, 1898, *Animal Intelligence*)  
5. **Clark L. Hull** – Drive reduction theory (Hull, 1943, *Principles of Behavior*)

### **10 Key Behaviorist Experiments**  
1. **Pavlov’s Dogs (Classical Conditioning)** – Pavlov (1927) showed that dogs could associate a neutral stimulus (bell) with food, leading to salivation without food present.  
2. **Skinner’s Operant Conditioning Box (Skinner Box, 1938)** – Demonstrated reinforcement schedules using rats pressing levers for food.  
3. **Little Albert (Watson & Rayner, 1920)** – Showed that emotional responses could be conditioned (fear of white rats via loud noise).  
4. **Thorndike’s Puzzle Box (1898)** – Cats learned escape strategies via trial and error (Law of Effect).  
5. **Token Economies (Ayllon & Azrin, 1965)** – Used secondary reinforcers (tokens) to shape behavior in psychiatric patients.  
6. **Premack Principle (Premack, 1959)** – High-probability behaviors reinforce low-probability ones (e.g., "Eat your vegetables before dessert").  
7. **Extinction of Phobias (Mary Cover Jones, 1924)** – Used counter-conditioning to reduce fear in children.  
8. **Fixed vs. Variable Reinforcement (Skinner, 1957)** – Compared fixed-ratio, variable-ratio, fixed-interval, and variable-interval schedules (Skinner, *Schedules of Reinforcement*).  
9. **Learned Helplessness (Seligman & Maier, 1967)** – Dogs exposed to unavoidable shocks stopped trying to escape.  
10. **Biofeedback Conditioning (Miller, 1969)** – Showed autonomic responses (heart rate) could be operantly conditioned.

### **Behaviorist Research Since the 1990s**  
Modern behaviorist research incorporates neuroscience, applied behavior analysis (ABA), and technology:  

#### **Reinforcement Types**  
- **Positive Reinforcement** – Adding a reward to increase behavior (e.g., praising a child for studying).  
- **Negative Reinforcement** – Removing an aversive stimulus to increase behavior (e.g., buckling a seatbelt to stop beeping).  
- **Punishment** – Adding a negative consequence (e.g., fines) or removing a positive one (e.g., timeout).  

#### **Reinforcement Schedules**  
1. **Fixed Ratio (FR)** – Reinforcement after a set number of responses (e.g., factory workers paid per unit).  
2. **Variable Ratio (VR)** – Reinforcement after unpredictable responses (e.g., gambling).  
3. **Fixed Interval (FI)** – Reinforcement after a set time (e.g., weekly paycheck).  
4. **Variable Interval (VI)** – Reinforcement at random times (e.g., pop quizzes).  

#### **Recent Studies**  
- **ABA & Autism** (Lovaas, 1987; Reichow et al., 2018) – Intensive reinforcement improves social skills.  
- **Behavioral Economics** (Rachlin, 2000) – Examines choice and delayed reinforcement.  
- **Neurobehaviorism** (Stephens et al., 2010) – Links dopamine release to reinforcement.  
- **Gamification & Learning** (Deterding et al., 2011) – Variable rewards in digital environments.  

### **Conclusion**  
Behaviorism remains influential, transitioning from animal studies to applications in **therapy, education, and AI training (reinforcement learning)**. Concepts like **intermittent reinforcement (VR schedules)** are widely used in digital marketing and habit formation (Aunger & Curtis, 2015).
