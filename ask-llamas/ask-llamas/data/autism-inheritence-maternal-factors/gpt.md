Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is recognized as a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by difficulties with social interaction, communication, repetitive behaviors, and constrained interests (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). Extensive research has highlighted multiple prenatal and genetic factors that potentially influence ASD risk. Below, evidence is presented concerning maternal health, weight, maternal age, genetic factors, and monozygotic twin studies.

### 1. Maternal Health, Weight, and Autism
Maternal health conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension during pregnancy have been clearly linked to increased risks for autism. For instance, Krakowiak et al. (2012) found that maternal obesity and diabetes were independently associated with increased autism risk. Specifically, maternal obesity during pregnancy has been consistently tied to increased prevalence of ASD in offspring. Li et al. (2016) performed a meta-analysis of seven cohort studies comprising over 500,000 participants, concluding that prepregnancy maternal obesity significantly increases autism risk. Additionally, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), maternal inflammation, and maternal metabolic conditions have also been implicated (Xi et al., 2022).

### 2. Maternal Age and Autism
Advanced maternal age at childbirth has also been consistently associated with increased ASD risk. Sandin et al. (2012), in a large epidemiological study encompassing Swedish cohort data (1.3 million births), indicated that mothers over the age of 35 had significantly higher likelihoods of having a child diagnosed with autism. Similarly, Durkin et al. (2008) reported elevated risks with increased maternal age, finding that ASD risk incrementally rose with each 5-year increase in maternal age.

### 3. Genetic Factors and Autism
Autism spectrum disorder is highly heritable. Emerging genetic evidence strongly underscores autism as polygenic, influenced by multiple genes contributing modest risk individually but collectively producing significant effects. Genetic research using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) highlights the importance of copy number variations (CNVs), rare de novo mutations, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ASD risk (Geschwind, 2011; Tick et al., 2016). For instance, the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) study identified that de novo mutations account significantly for ASD risk, particularly affecting genes related to neuronal synapse formation and function (Iossifov et al., 2014). Mutations in several identified genes (such as CHD8, SYNGAP1, SCN2A, and SHANK3) have been repeatedly demonstrated to associate strongly with increased autism susceptibility (De Rubeis et al., 2014; Satterstrom et al., 2020).

### 4. Monozygotic Twin Studies
Monozygotic twin studies underscore ASD’s genetic basis. Bailey et al. (1995) seminally reported higher concordance rates for ASD among monozygotic twins (approximately 60-90%) compared to dizygotic twins (0-10%). A more recent comprehensive study conducted by Tick et al. (2016) involving a systematic review of twin studies further supported these results, concluding that heritability estimates ranged from 64% to 91%. These studies strongly suggest sizeable genetic contributions to autism risk, highlighting genetic rather than purely environmental influences as critical mechanisms underpinning autism susceptibility.

### Conclusion
In summary, strong evidence highlights maternal prenatal health, obesity, advanced maternal age, and especially genetic factors as significantly raising ASD susceptibility. Genetic research, including monozygotic twin studies, confirms a powerful genetic component, indicating that ASD results from a complex interplay of genetic vulnerabilities and maternal environmental factors.
