Certainly! Below is a synthesized overview of the current academic understanding of how maternal health, weight, age, and genetic factors correlate with autism risk, with references to key studies, including monozygotic twin research.

### **Maternal Health, Weight, Age, and Genetic Factors in Autism Risk**

#### **1. Maternal Health and Weight**
- **Obesity and Diabetes**: Maternal obesity, diabetes (gestational or pre-existing), and metabolic conditions have been linked to an increased risk of autism in offspring.  
  - A large meta-analysis found that maternal obesity was associated with a 36% increased likelihood of ASD (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.19–1.56) (Wang et al., 2016).  
  - Maternal diabetes (especially gestational diabetes) is associated with a 48% higher autism risk, likely due to fetal exposure to hyperglycemia and inflammation (Xiang et al., 2015).  

- **Infections and Immune Activation**: Maternal infections (e.g., influenza, fever) and immune dysregulation (e.g., cytokine imbalances) during pregnancy are associated with autism risk (Estes & McAllister, 2016).  

#### **2. Maternal Age at Birth**
- **Advanced Maternal and Paternal Age**: Older maternal and paternal age are independently linked to autism.  
  - A meta-analysis found a 21% increase in autism risk for every 10-year increase in maternal age (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.10–1.34) (Sandin et al., 2016).  
  - Older paternal age contributes significantly due to increased *de novo* mutations in sperm (Hultman et al., 2011).  

#### **3. Genetic Factors**
- **Inherited and *De Novo* Mutations**: Autism has a strong genetic basis, with heritability estimates of **64–93%** based on twin studies (Tick et al., 2016).  
  - Common variants (polygenic risk) contribute ~40–60% of liability (Gaugler et al., 2014).  
  - Rare *de novo* mutations (e.g., *CHD8*, *SCN2A*) increase risk, particularly in sporadic cases (Iossifov et al., 2014).  

#### **4. Monozygotic (MZ) Twin Studies**
- **Concordance Rates in MZ vs. Dizygotic (DZ) Twins**:  
  - MZ twins show **36–95% concordance** for autism vs. **0–31% in DZ twins**, indicating strong genetic influences (Rosenberg et al., 2009; Hallmayer et al., 2011).  
  - Discordance in MZ twins (~60–80% for strict autism diagnosis) suggests **epigenetic** or **prenatal environmental factors** (Castelbaum et al., 2020).

#### **Epigenetic and Gene-Environment Interactions**
- Prenatal exposures (e.g., maternal inflammation, stress) may modulate genetic risk via DNA methylation (Loke et al., 2015).  
- A 2020 *Nature* study found that MZ twins discordant for autism had differential methylation patterns (Andrews et al., 2020).
