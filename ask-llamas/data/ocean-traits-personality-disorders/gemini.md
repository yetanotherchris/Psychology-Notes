Okay, here is a breakdown of the prominent factors (often referred to as facets or lower-order traits) within each OCEAN domain that are significantly linked to personality disorders (PDs), based on psychological research.

The Five-Factor Model (FFM; OCEAN) provides a dimensional framework for understanding personality, and contemporary research conceptualizes personality disorders as maladaptive variants or extremes of these general personality traits (Widiger & Costa, 2012; Samuel & Widiger, 2008).

Here are the key links for each trait:

**1. Neuroticism (vs. Emotional Stability)**
*   **General Link:** High Neuroticism is the most pervasive FFM domain associated with nearly all personality disorders, particularly those involving emotional dysregulation and distress (e.g., Borderline, Avoidant, Dependent PDs) and the internalizing spectrum more broadly (Trull & Durrett, 2005; Samuel & Widiger, 2008).
*   **Prominent Facets Linked to PDs:**
    *   **Anxiety:** Pervasive worry, tension, and fearfulness. Strongly linked to Avoidant, Dependent, and Borderline PDs (Bienvenu et al., 2004).
    *   **Angry Hostility:** Tendency towards anger, bitterness, and frustration. Central to the antagonism component seen in Borderline PD, Passive-Aggressive traits, and some features of Narcissistic and Antisocial PDs (Martin et al., 2013).
    *   **Depression (Affective Lability):** Propensity for sadness, guilt, hopelessness, and mood swings. A core feature of Borderline PD (affective instability) and common in Avoidant and Dependent PDs (Trull et al., 2003).
    *   **Self-Consciousness:** Sensitivity to criticism, feelings of inferiority, shame, and embarrassment. Highly characteristic of Avoidant PD and contributes to the interpersonal difficulties in Dependent and Borderline PDs (Samuel & Widiger, 2008).
    *   **Impulsiveness (Emotion-Driven):** Difficulty controlling urges and cravings, often driven by negative affect. A key component of Borderline PD (e.g., self-harm, substance use) and contributes to the erratic behavior seen in some Cluster B disorders (Whiteside & Lynam, 2001; Miller et al., 2010). *Note: This facet differs from the deliberation facet under Conscientiousness.*
    *   **Vulnerability:** Difficulty coping with stress, feeling overwhelmed and dependent. Strongly associated with Dependent, Borderline, and Avoidant PDs (Costa & McCrae, 1992; Widiger & Costa, 2012).

**2. Agreeableness (vs. Antagonism)**
*   **General Link:** Low Agreeableness (Antagonism) is a core feature of Cluster B personality disorders, particularly Antisocial and Narcissistic PDs, and is also relevant to Paranoid PD (Widiger & Costa, 2012; Miller et al., 2011).
*   **Prominent Facets (Low End) Linked to PDs:**
    *   **Low Trust:** Cynicism, skepticism, belief that others are deceptive or harmful. Central to Paranoid PD and contributes to interpersonal problems in Antisocial and Borderline PDs (Samuel & Widiger, 2008).
    *   **Low Straightforwardness (Deceitfulness):** Tendency to manipulate, lie, and be cunning. A defining feature of Antisocial PD (Lynam & Derefinko, 2006).
    *   **Low Altruism (Exploitativeness):** Lack of concern for others' well-being, selfishness, using others. Characteristic of Antisocial and Narcissistic PDs (Miller et al., 2011).
    *   **Low Compliance (Aggression/Oppositional):** Tendency to be aggressive, defiant, stubborn, and critical. Linked to Antisocial PD, Passive-Aggressive traits, and the hostility seen in Borderline and Paranoid PDs (Martin et al., 2013).
    *   **Low Modesty (Grandiosity):** Feelings of superiority, arrogance, boastfulness. A hallmark of Narcissistic PD (Samuel & Widiger, 2006).
    *   **Low Tender-Mindedness (Callousness):** Lack of empathy, tough-mindedness, lack of concern for others' suffering. Strongly associated with the psychopathy construct within Antisocial PD (Lynam & Derefinko, 2006; Decuyper et al., 2009).

**3. Conscientiousness (vs. Disinhibition/Compulsivity)**
*   **General Link:** Primarily *low* Conscientiousness (Disinhibition) is linked to impulsive and undercontrolled behaviors seen in Antisocial and Borderline PDs. *High* Conscientiousness (Compulsivity), particularly certain facets, is strongly linked to Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) (Samuel & Widiger, 2008; Gore & Widiger, 2013).
*   **Prominent Facets (Low End) Linked to PDs:**
    *   **Low Competence:** Feeling incapable or ineffective. Can contribute to dependency (Dependent PD) or identity issues (Borderline PD).
    *   **Low Order:** Disorganization, messiness. Less directly linked to PD core criteria but contributes to general dysfunction.
    *   **Low Dutifulness (Irresponsibility):** Lack of reliability, carelessness with obligations. A key feature of Antisocial PD (Lynam & Derefinko, 2006).
    *   **Low Achievement Striving:** Lack of ambition, laziness, poor follow-through. Contributes to functional impairment across many PDs, particularly Antisocial PD.
    *   **Low Self-Discipline:** Difficulty starting tasks, procrastination, inability to persist. Linked to impulsivity and behavioral dysregulation in Borderline and Antisocial PDs (Miller et al., 2010).
    *   **Low Deliberation (Impulsivity):** Acting without thinking, rashness. Central to the impulsivity criterion in Borderline PD and characteristic of Antisocial PD (Whiteside & Lynam, 2001).
*   **Prominent Facets (High End) Linked to PDs:**
    *   **High Order:** Need for neatness, routine, structure.
    *   **High Dutifulness:** Strong sense of obligation, scrupulousness.
    *   **High Self-Discipline:** Ability to stay focused and motivated.
    *   *(Maladaptive) High Achievement Striving (Workaholism):* Excessive devotion to work, perfectionism.
    *   *(Maladaptive) High Deliberation (Rigidity):* Inflexibility, inability to change plans.
    *   **Key Link:** Specific combinations of high C facets, particularly high Order, Dutifulness, Achievement Striving (expressed as perfectionism interfering with completion), and Deliberation (expressed as rigidity), are central to **Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD)** (Gore & Widiger, 2013; Samuel & Widiger, 2011). *Note OCPD is distinct from OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, an anxiety disorder).*

**4. Extraversion (vs. Introversion)**
*   **General Link:** Both poles are relevant. *Low* Extraversion (Introversion) is linked to Cluster C PDs (Avoidant, Dependent - though less so) and Cluster A PDs (Schizoid, Schizotypal). *High* Extraversion can be linked to Cluster B PDs (Histrionic, Narcissistic) (Watson et al., 1994; Samuel & Widiger, 2008).
*   **Prominent Facets (Low End - Introversion) Linked to PDs:**
    *   **Low Warmth (Coldness/Aloofness):** Lack of interpersonal closeness, reserved. Characteristic of Schizoid PD and contributes to Paranoid PD's suspicious detachment (Quirk et al., 2012).
    *   **Low Gregariousness:** Avoiding crowds and social gatherings. Central to Avoidant and Schizoid PDs (Samuel & Widiger, 2008).
    *   **Low Assertiveness:** Difficulty expressing needs, passivity. Associated with Dependent and Avoidant PDs.
    *   **Low Activity Level:** Lethargy, passivity. May be seen in Schizoid or Dependent PDs.
    *   **Low Excitement Seeking:** Dislike of stimulation, thrills. Contributes to the profile of Schizoid PD.
    *   **Low Positive Emotions (Anhedonia):** Reduced capacity to experience joy and pleasure. Strongly associated with Schizoid PD and contributes to deficits in Schizotypal and Avoidant PDs (Watson et al., 1994; Blanchard et al., 2001).
*   **Prominent Facets (High End - Extraversion) Linked to PDs:**
    *   **High Assertiveness (Domineering):** Forceful expression of opinions, taking charge (can manifest as dominance). Can contribute to Narcissistic PD features (Miller et al., 2011).
    *   **High Excitement Seeking:** Craving stimulation and risk. Linked to Antisocial PD (thrill-seeking) and Borderline PD (impulsive behaviors) (Whiteside & Lynam, 2001).
    *   *(Maladaptive) High Gregariousness/Warmth (Attention-Seeking):* Need to be the center of attention, overly expressive/dramatic. Central to Histrionic PD (Samuel & Widiger, 2008).

**5. Openness to Experience (vs. Closedness)**
*   **General Link:** This domain has more complex and sometimes weaker links to PDs compared to N and A. High Openness (particularly specific facets related to unusual experiences) is associated with Schizotypal PD. Low Openness (Closedness/Rigidity) may contribute to OCPD and Paranoid PD (Widiger et al., 2009; Kwapil et al., 2002).
*   **Prominent Facets Linked to PDs:**
    *   **High Fantasy:** Vivid imagination, tendency towards daydreaming (can become detachment from reality). Linked to Schizotypal PD (odd beliefs, magical thinking) (Kwapil et al., 2002).
    *   **High Aesthetics:** Appreciation for art and beauty. Less consistently linked to PD pathology itself.
    *   **High Feelings:** Receptivity to inner emotions. May contribute to the intensity in BPD, but low Openness to feelings is also possible in PDs involving emotional restriction (e.g., Schizoid).
    *   **High Actions (Unconventionality):** Preference for novelty and variety over routine. High unconventionality linked to Schizotypal PD (eccentric behavior) andimpulsivity aspects of Cluster B (Widiger et al., 2009). *Low* preference for novelty (rigidity) could link to OCPD.
    *   **High Ideas (Intellectual Curiosity):** Tendency towards intellectual pursuits, open-mindedness. High facet related to unusual ideas/beliefs is relevant to Schizotypal PD (odd thinking and speech) (Rosenman et al., 2010). *Low* Openness to Ideas (dogmatism) might contribute to Paranoid PD or OCPD rigidity.
    *   **High Values (Liberalism/Unconventional):** Readiness to re-examine social, political, and religious values. Extreme unconventional values can be part of Schizotypal or Antisocial presentations. *Low* Openness to Values (dogmatism/conservatism) could feature in OCPD's rigidity or Paranoid PD's suspiciousness of difference.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Dimensionality:** PDs are best understood dimensionally as maladaptive expressions or combinations of these trait facets, rather than completely distinct categories (Widiger & Trull, 2007).
*   **Configuration:** No single facet perfectly predicts a PD. It's the specific *configuration* or profile of high and low facets across multiple OCEAN domains that characterizes a particular PD (Samuel & Widiger, 2008).
*   **Maladaptiveness:** It is the *extremity* and *rigidity* of these traits, causing significant distress or impairment in functioning, that constitutes pathology (Widiger & Costa, 2012).

This list highlights the major research findings linking FFM facets to personality disorders, providing a more nuanced view than considering the broad domains alone.
