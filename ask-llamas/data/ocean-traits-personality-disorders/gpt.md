The Five-Factor Model (also known as the Big Five or OCEAN model) is widely cited in personality psychology as a useful framework to understand personality disorders (PDs). Each trait—Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism—has particular sub-factors or facets closely related to personality disorders, according to peer-reviewed research and theory.

Below are prominent factors or facets within each of the OCEAN traits, drawn from key psychological and psychiatric research:

### 1. **Openness (to experience):**
*Openness is generally less directly implicated in personality disorders compared to other traits, yet its specific facets can be related systematically:*  
- **Facet linked:** Unusual thinking, unusual beliefs (fantasy factor), and perceptual distortions. Low openness (rigidity, narrow-mindedness) characterizes obsessive-compulsive PD, whereas high openness facets (unusual ideation) may relate to schizotypal characteristics.

### 2. **Conscientiousness:**
- **Facets linked:** Low Conscientiousness strongly relates to impulsivity, irresponsibility, lack of planning, and disorganization found in Cluster B disorders (antisocial and borderline), whereas excessively High Conscientiousness is linked to obsessive-compulsive PD features (perfectionism, rigid rules).  
- **Relevant citations:**

### 3. **Extraversion:**
- **Facets linked:** Excessively low Extraversion (detachment, social withdrawal, low sociability, restricted emotional expression) is commonly associated with Cluster A disorders (schizoid, schizotypal, paranoid), and avoidant PD. Conversely, excessive Extraversion (attention-seeking, dramatic affect) is related to narcissistic and histrionic PD traits. Thus facets such as Sociability, Positive Emotions, Warmth, and Excitement-Seeking link differentially in disorders.

### 4. **Agreeableness:**
- **Facets linked:** Low Agreeableness consistently emerges as an extremely predictive trait of personality disorders that include antagonistic and hostile interactions (antisocial, narcissistic, paranoid, borderline). It involves trust issues, lack of empathy, cold-heartedness, hostility, manipulativeness, aggressiveness.

### 5. **Neuroticism:**
- **Facets linked:** Neuroticism is highly relevant to virtually all personality disorders, involving emotional instability, depressive tendencies, anxiety, anger-hostility, vulnerability to stress and impulsivity. Specifically, negative emotionality and emotional dysregulation are central aspects of borderline PD, avoidant PD (anxiety), and dependent PD (excessive anxiety, vulnerability).

### Summary Table:
|**OCEAN Trait**|Relevant Facets Linked to Personality Disorders | Personality Disorder Examples |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Openness**        | Unusual Ideation, Rigidity, Unusual Thoughts, Perceptual Distortion | Schizotypal (high openness), Obsessive-Compulsive PD (low openness) |
| **Conscientiousness** | Impulsivity, Irresponsibility, Perfectionism (in either extreme) | Antisocial (low), Borderline (low), Obsessive-Compulsive PD (high) |
| **Extraversion**     | Detachment (low E), Attention-seeking, Dominance, Emotional Intensity (high E) | Schizoid, Schizotypal, Avoidant PD (low extraversion), Histrionic, Narcissistic (high extraversion) |
| **Agreeableness**    | Antagonism, Lack of Empathy, Hostility, Manipulativeness | Narcissistic, Antisocial, Paranoid, Borderline |
| **Neuroticism**      | Emotional Instability, Dysregulated Anger, Anxiety, Vulnerability to Stress | Borderline, Avoidant, Dependent, and others |

Overall, extensive empirical research suggests that personality disorders reflect extreme or maladaptive manifestations of the general personality structure described by the OCEAN model.
