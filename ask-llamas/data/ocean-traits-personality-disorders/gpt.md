Research in psychology has identified the Five Factor Model (FFM), popularly known as the OCEAN model, as a robust framework for understanding personality disorders. Each of its five dimensions—Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism—contains factors linked to specific personality disorders. Below, prominent facets or subfactors for each trait along with their associations with personality disorders are outlined, drawing from scholarly literature:

### 1. **Openness (O)**:
While Openness is generally less consistently linked to personality disorders compared to other traits, some connections are notable:
- **Lower Openness to Experience** has been correlated particularly with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), characterized by rigidity, difficulty adapting to new experiences, and resistance towards changes or novel stimuli (Samuel & Widiger, 2008).
- Conversely, certain Cluster A disorders, such as schizotypal personality disorder, have shown unique patterns, including elevated openness to certain unconventional ideas and anomalous experiences (DeYoung et al., 2012).

### 2. **Conscientiousness (C)**:
Lower conscientiousness appears prominently in several disorders, influencing impulse control and responsibility level:
- **Low conscientiousness (especially impulsivity facet)** strongly correlates with antisocial, borderline, and narcissistic personality disorders, highlighting patterns of irresponsibility, impulsivity, and lack of discipline (Lynam & Widiger, 2001).
- Elevated conscientiousness to a vey rigid and perfectionistic degree is characteristic of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), manifesting as excessive order and meticulousness (Samuel & Widiger, 2008).

### 3. **Extraversion (E)**:
Extraversion and its subcomponents (especially positive emotion, social dominance, and sociability) have distinct associations with different disorders:
- **Low Extraversion (introversion)** has consistently been linked to avoidant, schizotypal, and schizoid personality disorders, reflecting reduced social interest, diminished positive emotionality, and withdrawal (Widiger & Costa, 2013).
- Certain maladaptive aspects of higher extraversion, such as sensation-seeking and dominance, are implicated in narcissistic and histrionic personality disorders (Samuel & Widiger, 2004).

### 4. **Agreeableness (A)**:
Agreeableness is strongly associated with interpersonal behaviors, and deviations are common in multiple disorders:
- **Low Agreeableness (antagonism facet)** strongly predicts antisocial, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders, revealing tendencies of mistrust, manipulativeness, callousness, and interpersonal conflict (Widiger, 2011).
- Conversely, overly high agreeableness, associated with excessive compliance and dependence, might be observed in dependent personality disorder (Mullins-Sweatt et al., 2006).

### 5. **Neuroticism (N)**:
Elevated neuroticism is one of the strongest and most consistent predictors across nearly all personality disorders:
- **High Neuroticism (specifically anxiety, hostility, depression, impulsiveness, vulnerability)** is linked with borderline, avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders. Individuals with these conditions frequently display emotional instability, heightened sensitivity to stress, emotional dysregulation, and difficulties coping (Widiger & Samuel, 2005).
- High neuroticism is also correlated with impaired emotional regulation, commonly observed in borderline personality disorder (Samuel & Widiger, 2008).

### Summary:
The OCEAN traits correlate differently across personality disorders:

- **Openness**– lowered Openness relates to rigidity (OCPD), elevated Openness to eccentric and schizotypal traits.
- **Conscientiousness**– Low conscientiousness is linked with impulsivity (antisocial, borderline), high conscientiousness to perfectionism (OCPD).
- **Extraversion**– Low extraversion relates to social withdrawal (schizoid, avoidant), elevated extraversion links to narcissistic traits.
- **Agreeableness**– Low agreeableness connected to antisocial and narcissistic traits; overly high relates to dependent traits.
- **Neuroticism**– High neuroticism strongly associated with emotional dysregulation disorders (borderline, avoidant, dependent).

This review underscores how specific facets within OCEAN traits robustly predict certain personality disorder characteristics and diagnoses.
