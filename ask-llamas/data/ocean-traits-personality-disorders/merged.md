# Relationship Between OCEAN Traits and Personality Disorders: Research Synthesis

Based on psychological research, here are the prominent factors from each of the Big Five (OCEAN) personality traits linked to various personality disorders:

## Openness to Experience

- **Low openness**: Associated with schizoid personality disorder (social detachment, limited emotional expression) [1] and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (rigidity, narrow-mindedness) [1][2]
- **High openness**: Linked to specific facets of schizotypal personality disorder (unusual ideation, eccentric thinking, magical beliefs) [1][2]
- **Peculiar/eccentric openness profiles**: Elevated openness to fantasy but reduced openness to actions in schizotypal personality disorder [1]
- **Extreme openness to feelings**: Can present in histrionic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder [1][2]

## Conscientiousness

- **Extremely high conscientiousness**: Strongly associated with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (excessive orderliness, perfectionism, rigid rules, and control) [1][2]
- **Very low conscientiousness**: Linked to antisocial and borderline personality disorders (impulsivity, irresponsibility, poor behavioral control, lack of long-term planning) [1][2]
- **Low self-discipline facet**: Strongly associated with borderline personality disorder features [1]
- **Low dutifulness**: A key feature of antisocial personality disorder [1]

## Extraversion

- **Low extraversion (introversion)**: Characteristic of avoidant, schizoid, and schizotypal personality disorders (social detachment, withdrawal, restricted emotional expression) [1][2]
- **High extraversion**: Associated with histrionic personality disorder (attention-seeking, excessive emotional expression) [1][2]
- **High assertiveness with low warmth**: Common in narcissistic personality disorder [1]
- **Low warmth (coldness/aloofness)**: Characteristic of schizoid personality disorder and contributes to paranoid personality disorder's suspicious detachment [1]
- **Low positive emotions (anhedonia)**: Strongly associated with schizoid personality disorder [1]

## Agreeableness

- **Low agreeableness**: Strongly associated with antisocial, narcissistic, and paranoid personality disorders (antagonism, hostility, lack of empathy) [1][2]
- **Low trust facet**: Central to paranoid personality disorder [1]
- **Low straightforwardness (deceitfulness)**: A defining feature of antisocial personality disorder [1]
- **Low compliance and straightforwardness**: Characteristic of antisocial personality disorder [1]
- **Low modesty (grandiosity)**: A hallmark of narcissistic personality disorder [1]
- **Low tender-mindedness (callousness)**: Strongly associated with psychopathic features within antisocial personality disorder [1]
- **Extreme high agreeableness**: Can contribute to dependent personality disorder (submissiveness, excessive compliance) [1][2]

## Neuroticism

- **High neuroticism**: Broadly associated with most personality disorders, particularly:
  - Borderline (emotional instability, mood swings, chronic emptiness) [1][2]
  - Avoidant (anxiety, hypersensitivity to criticism) [1][2]
  - Dependent (fear of abandonment, excessive anxiety) [1][2]
- **High angry hostility facet**: Linked to borderline and antisocial personality disorders [1]
- **High anxiety and vulnerability facets**: Central to avoidant personality disorder [1]
- **High self-consciousness facet**: Prominent in avoidant personality disorder [1]
- **High depression (affective lability)**: A core feature of borderline personality disorder [1]
- **Low neuroticism**: In specific contexts, may be associated with antisocial personality disorder traits (lack of remorse or anxiety over harmful behaviors) [2]

## Key Research Findings

Research consistently shows that personality disorders represent maladaptive extremes or specific combinations of normal personality traits [1][2]. Neuroticism and agreeableness show particularly strong associations across multiple disorders [1]. Recent dimensional approaches to personality disorders, as seen in the DSM-5 Alternative Model, increasingly utilize the Five-Factor Model as a framework for understanding personality pathology [2].
