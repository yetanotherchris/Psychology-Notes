# Relationship Between OCEAN Traits and Personality Disorders: Research Synthesis

# OCEAN Traits and Their Relationship to Personality Disorders

Research has established strong connections between the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality, commonly known as the OCEAN model, and various personality disorders. Below are the prominent factors from each OCEAN trait linked to personality disorders based on psychological research:

## Neuroticism

Neuroticism is perhaps the most consistently implicated trait in personality disorders [1].

- **Anxiety and Emotional Instability**: Strongly associated with Avoidant Personality Disorder and Dependent Personality Disorder [1]
- **Anger/Hostility**: Linked to Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorders [1]
- **Depression**: Prominent in Avoidant and Dependent Personality Disorders [1]
- **Self-consciousness**: Associated with Avoidant Personality Disorder [1]
- **Impulsivity**: Central to Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorders [1]
- **Negative Affectivity**: Broadly linked to nearly all personality disorders, especially Borderline, Avoidant, and Dependent [3]

## Extraversion

Extraversion shows varied relationships with personality disorders:

- **Low Warmth**: Associated with Schizoid and Schizotypal Personality Disorders [1]
- **Low Gregariousness/Social Withdrawal**: Characteristic of Avoidant, Schizoid, and Schizotypal Personality Disorders [1][3]
- **Assertiveness**: High levels present in Narcissistic Personality Disorder; extremely low in Dependent Personality Disorder [1][3]
- **Excitement-seeking**: High levels related to Antisocial and Histrionic Personality Disorders [1][2]
- **Attention-seeking**: Characteristic of Histrionic and Narcissistic Personality Disorders [2]
- **Low Positive Emotions/Anhedonia**: Linked to Schizoid, Schizotypal, and Avoidant Personality Disorders [3]

## Openness to Experience

Openness shows more complex relationships with personality disorders:

- **Fantasy/Fantasy Proneness**: High levels associated with Schizotypal Personality Disorder [1][3]
- **Low Openness to Actions/Values/Ideas**: Related to rigid aspects of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder [1][3]
- **Unusual Perceptions/Experiences**: Strongly associated with Schizotypal Personality Disorder [3]
- **Low Aesthetics and Feelings**: Linked to Schizoid Personality Disorder [1]

## Agreeableness

Agreeableness facets show strong correlations with several personality disorders:

- **Low Trust/Cynicism**: Characteristic of Paranoid Personality Disorder [1][3]
- **Low Straightforwardness**: Associated with Antisocial and Narcissistic Personality Disorders [1]
- **Low Altruism**: Present in Antisocial Personality Disorder [1]
- **Low Compliance/Oppositional**: Strongly linked to Antisocial, Borderline, and Narcissistic Personality Disorders [1][3]
- **Low Modesty/Grandiosity**: Central to Narcissistic Personality Disorder [1][3]
- **Antagonism/Hostility**: Core feature of Antisocial, Narcissistic, Paranoid, and Borderline Personality Disorders [3]

## Conscientiousness

Conscientiousness facets demonstrate important links to personality disorders:

- **Low Competence**: Associated with Dependent Personality Disorder [1]
- **Order**: Extremely high levels central to Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder; low levels seen in Borderline and sometimes Schizotypal Personality Disorders [1][3]
- **Low Dutifulness/Irresponsibility**: Linked to Antisocial Personality Disorder [1][3]
- **Achievement Striving**: High levels characteristic of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder [1]
- **Low Self-Discipline**: Present in Borderline Personality Disorder [1]
- **Low Deliberation/Risk-Taking**: Associated with impulsive traits in Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorders [1][3]

This research demonstrates that personality disorders can be conceptualized as extreme and maladaptive variants of normal personality traits as described by the OCEAN model. Each personality disorder shows a characteristic pattern across multiple facets of the five major domains [1].
