Certainly! The **Five-Factor Model (FFM)**, also known as the **OCEAN model** (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism), has been extensively studied in relation to **personality disorders (PDs)**. Below are the prominent factors from each trait linked to PDs, supported by psychological research:

### **1. Openness to Experience (O)**
- **Low Openness**: Associated with **schizotypal personality disorder** (odd/eccentric traits) due to cognitive rigidity and reduced creativity (Widiger & Costa, 2013).  
- **High Openness**: Linked to **borderline PD** (instability in identity and affect) and **narcissistic PD** (grandiose fantasies) (Samuel & Widiger, 2008).  

### **2. Conscientiousness (C)**
- **Low Conscientiousness**: Strongly linked to **antisocial PD** (impulsivity, irresponsibility) and **borderline PD** (poor impulse control) (Lynam & Widiger, 2001).  
- **High Conscientiousness**: Observed in **obsessive-compulsive PD** (perfectionism, rigidity) (Samuel & Widiger, 2011).  

### **3. Extraversion (E)**
- **Low Extraversion**: Associated with **schizoid PD** (social detachment) and **avoidant PD** (social inhibition) (Saulsman & Page, 2004).  
- **High Extraversion**: Linked to **histrionic PD** (attention-seeking) and **narcissistic PD** (dominance, exhibitionism) (Widiger & Mullins-Sweatt, 2009).  

### **4. Agreeableness (A)**
- **Low Agreeableness**: Strong predictor of **antisocial PD** (hostility, exploitation) and **narcissistic PD** (entitlement, lack of empathy) (Miller et al., 2010).  
- **High Agreeableness**: Sometimes seen in **dependent PD** (submissiveness, excessive compliance) (Gore & Widiger, 2016).  

### **5. Neuroticism (N)**
- **High Neuroticism**: Central to **borderline PD** (emotional instability), **avoidant PD** (anxiety, hypersensitivity), and **dependent PD** (fear of abandonment) (Kotov et al., 2010).  
- **Low Neuroticism**: Seen in **psychopathic traits** (emotional detachment) (Lynam & Miller, 2015).
