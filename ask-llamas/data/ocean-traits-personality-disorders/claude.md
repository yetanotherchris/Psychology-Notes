# OCEAN Traits and Personality Disorders: Research-Based Connections

Below are the prominent factors from each of the Big Five (OCEAN) personality traits that research has linked to various personality disorders:

## Openness to Experience

- **Low openness**: Associated with schizoid personality disorder, characterized by limited emotional expression and social detachment (McCrae & Costa, 2008)
- **Peculiar/eccentric openness profiles**: Linked to schizotypal personality disorder, particularly elevated openness to fantasy but reduced openness to actions (Widiger & Costa, 2013)
- **Extreme openness to feelings**: Can present in histrionic personality disorder (Samuel & Widiger, 2008)

## Conscientiousness

- **Extremely high conscientiousness**: Associated with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, particularly excessive orderliness, perfectionism, and control (Samuel & Widiger, 2011)
- **Very low conscientiousness**: Linked to antisocial and borderline personality disorders, manifesting as impulsivity and poor behavioral control (Trull & Widiger, 2013)
- **Low self-discipline facet**: Strongly associated with borderline personality disorder features (Bagby et al., 2005)

## Extraversion

- **Low extraversion (introversion)**: Characteristic of avoidant, schizoid, and schizotypal personality disorders (Saulsman & Page, 2004)
- **High assertiveness with low warmth**: Common in narcissistic personality disorder (Miller et al., 2011)
- **High attention-seeking facet**: Prominent in histrionic personality disorder (Costa & McCrae, 2005)

## Agreeableness

- **Low agreeableness**: Strongly associated with antisocial, narcissistic, and paranoid personality disorders (Kotov et al., 2010)
- **Low trust facet**: Central to paranoid personality disorder (Widiger et al., 2009)
- **Low compliance and straightforwardness**: Characteristic of antisocial personality disorder (Lynam & Widiger, 2007)
- **Extreme high agreeableness**: Can contribute to dependent personality disorder (Samuel & Widiger, 2010)

## Neuroticism

- **High neuroticism**: Broadly associated with most personality disorders, particularly borderline, avoidant, and dependent (Widiger & Oltmanns, 2017)
- **High angry hostility facet**: Linked to borderline and antisocial personality disorders (Trull, 2012)
- **High anxiety and vulnerability facets**: Central to avoidant personality disorder (Morey et al., 2016)
- **High self-consciousness facet**: Prominent in avoidant personality disorder (Samuel & Widiger, 2008)

Research consistently shows that personality disorders represent maladaptive extremes or combinations of normal personality traits, with neuroticism and agreeableness showing particularly strong associations across multiple disorders (Clark, 2007; Widiger & Trull, 2007).
