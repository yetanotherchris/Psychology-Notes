## Evidence Overview

### 1. Epidemiological Evidence  

Multiple cohort and case-control studies have investigated associations between prenatal exposure to paracetamol and later neurodevelopmental outcomes, including ASD.

A large prospective birth cohort study by Liew et al. (2016) found that maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was associated with a modestly increased risk for ASD and ADHD symptoms in children ([10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.3947](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.3947)). The study analyzed more than 64,000 Danish mother–child pairs and controlled for a wide range of confounding factors.

A Spanish birth cohort study (the INMA project) similarly reported that children exposed prenatally to paracetamol showed an increased risk of ASD and attention-related symptoms, particularly among male offspring (Avella-Garcia et al., 2016; [10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.0159](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.0159)).

In the U.S.-based Boston Birth Cohort (Ji et al., 2020), researchers quantified cord plasma biomarkers of acetaminophen exposure and identified a dose–response relationship with later ASD diagnosis ([10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.3259](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.3259)).

### 2. Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews  

A systematic review and meta-analysis by Masarwa et al. (2018) pooled data from observational studies and found a significant association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and an increased risk of both ASD and ADHD in offspring ([10.1097/EDE.0000000000000766](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1097/EDE.0000000000000766)).

Another meta-analysis by Alemany et al. (2021) using individual participant data from six European birth cohorts reinforced these findings. The authors reported about a 19% higher risk of ASD in acetaminophen-exposed children compared with unexposed ones ([10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010919-023746](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010919-023746)).

### 3. Proposed Mechanisms  

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain how paracetamol could affect fetal neurodevelopment:

- **Oxidative stress and inflammation:** Acetaminophen overdose depletes glutathione and increases oxidative stress, which might interfere with brain development.  
- **Endocrine and neurotransmitter disruption:** Changes in prostaglandin metabolism and endocannabinoid signaling during critical neurodevelopmental periods have been suggested as mechanisms (Bauer et al., 2018; [10.1080/15592294.2018.1445459](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1080/15592294.2018.1445459)).

### 4. Limitations and Cautions  

Despite observed associations, causal inference remains uncertain. Common limitations include residual confounding (e.g., maternal infection, fever, pain, or other indications for paracetamol use), recall bias, and measurement error in exposure assessment. The associations are consistently modest in effect size and require careful interpretation in the context of potential confounding.  

Recent reviews emphasize that acetaminophen remains one of the safest analgesics for limited use during pregnancy, but they advocate for **judicious use** and further mechanistic research (Thiele et al., 2021; [10.1016/j.reprotox.2021.05.010](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1016/j.reprotox.2021.05.010)).

**Summary:**  
Overall, current evidence indicates a **potential association** between prenatal paracetamol exposure and increased risk of ASD, though **causality has not been demonstrated**. Further longitudinal and mechanistic studies are needed to clarify the biological pathways and the magnitude of any true risk.
