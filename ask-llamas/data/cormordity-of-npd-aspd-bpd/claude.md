# Comorbidity of Narcissistic, Borderline, and Antisocial Personality Traits and Disorders

## Overview of Personality Disorder Comorbidity

The comorbidity between Cluster B personality disorders (Narcissistic Personality Disorder [NPD], Borderline Personality Disorder [BPD], and Antisocial Personality Disorder [ASPD]) has been extensively documented in the literature. These disorders share overlapping features including emotional dysregulation, interpersonal difficulties, and impulsivity (Fossati et al., 2005 [10.1521/pedi.2005.19.5.551](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1521/pedi.2005.19.5.551)).

## NPD and BPD Comorbidity

### Prevalence and Clinical Presentation

Research indicates substantial comorbidity between NPD and BPD. McGlashan et al. (2000) found that approximately 37% of patients with BPD also met criteria for NPD in the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study [10.1176/appi.ajp.157.12.2011](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1176/appi.ajp.157.12.2011). This comorbidity is associated with greater severity of psychopathology and poorer treatment outcomes.

Gunderson et al. (2013) identified that patients with comorbid NPD-BPD demonstrate distinct clinical features, including heightened interpersonal exploitation, greater anger, and more severe identity disturbance compared to those with BPD alone [10.1521/pedi_2013_27_094](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1521/pedi_2013_27_094).

### Theoretical Perspectives

Kernberg's (1975, 1984) concept of borderline personality organization provides a theoretical framework for understanding this comorbidity. He proposed that narcissistic pathology exists on a spectrum with borderline pathology, sharing an underlying borderline personality organization characterized by identity diffusion, primitive defenses, and maintained reality testing (Kernberg, 1975).

Diamond et al. (2014) empirically tested Kernberg's model and found support for narcissistic personality as a variant of borderline personality organization, particularly in terms of shared identity pathology [10.1521/pedi_2013_27_096](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1521/pedi_2013_27_096).

## ASPD Comorbidity with NPD and BPD

### ASPD and NPD

The relationship between ASPD and NPD has been well-documented. Stinson et al. (2008) found that individuals with NPD had significantly elevated rates of ASPD (24.9%) in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions [10.4088/jcp.v69n0701](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.4088/jcp.v69n0701).

Hare (1991) conceptualized psychopathy as comprising two factors, with Factor 1 representing narcissistic and callous-unemotional traits. This conceptualization highlights the intrinsic relationship between narcissistic features and antisocial pathology.

### ASPD and BPD

Tomko et al. (2014) conducted a systematic review revealing that ASPD co-occurs with BPD in approximately 14-20% of cases [10.1017/S0033291713000482](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1017/S0033291713000482). This comorbidity is associated with increased impulsivity, substance use, and aggressive behavior.

Newhill et al. (2009) found that the co-occurrence of ASPD and BPD was particularly associated with increased violence risk and poorer treatment outcomes [10.1016/j.cpr.2008.09.001](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1016/j.cpr.2008.09.001).

## Directionality of Comorbidity

### Asymmetric Comorbidity Patterns

Research suggests asymmetric patterns in personality disorder comorbidity. While individuals with NPD or ASPD frequently show borderline traits, not all individuals with BPD exhibit narcissistic or antisocial features.

Zanarini et al. (2004) found in the McLean Study of Adult Development that while 39.2% of BPD patients had comorbid NPD, and 13.7% had comorbid ASPD, a substantial proportion of BPD patients (approximately 40%) had no comorbid Cluster B personality disorder [10.1521/pedi.18.1.73.32772](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1521/pedi.18.1.73.32772).

### BPD Without Narcissistic or Antisocial Features

Grant et al. (2008) demonstrated in a nationally representative sample that many individuals with BPD do not exhibit comorbid narcissistic or antisocial traits, suggesting distinct subtypes of BPD [10.4088/jcp.v69n0404](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.4088/jcp.v69n0404).

Skodol et al. (2002) identified that "pure" BPD (without other personality disorder comorbidity) represents a clinically meaningful subgroup with distinct treatment needs and outcomes [10.1176/appi.ajp.159.2.284](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1176/appi.ajp.159.2.284).

## Clinical and Research Implications

### Dimensional Models

The high comorbidity rates have led researchers to propose dimensional models of personality pathology. Sharp et al. (2015) argued for a hierarchical model where a general personality pathology factor underlies all personality disorders, with specific factors accounting for unique variance [10.1037/per0000115](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1037/per0000115).

Wright et al. (2012) used empirical methods to demonstrate that personality pathology is better conceptualized dimensionally, with narcissistic, borderline, and antisocial features representing overlapping but distinct dimensions [10.1037/a0027388](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1037/a0027388).

### Treatment Considerations

The presence of comorbid personality pathology significantly impacts treatment planning and outcomes. Clarkin et al. (2007) found that transference-focused psychotherapy showed differential effectiveness based on the presence of narcissistic features in BPD patients [10.1176/ajp.2007.164.6.922](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1176/ajp.2007.164.6.922).

## Conclusion

The research demonstrates substantial comorbidity between narcissistic, borderline, and antisocial personality features. While these disorders frequently co-occur, the relationship is not symmetricalâ€”individuals with NPD or ASPD commonly exhibit borderline traits, but many individuals with BPD do not necessarily manifest narcissistic or antisocial features. This asymmetric pattern suggests distinct etiological pathways and highlights the importance of comprehensive assessment and individualized treatment approaches for personality pathology.

The high rates of comorbidity support contemporary moves toward dimensional models of personality pathology, as reflected in the Alternative Model for Personality Disorders in DSM-5 Section III, which may better capture the complexity of these overlapping conditions than traditional categorical approaches.
