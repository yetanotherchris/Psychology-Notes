Sure — I will summarise the research evidence surrounding the co‑morbidity of narcissistic traits (including pathological and subclinical narcissism), borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits, and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) traits, and provide citations with DOI links in the format you specified.

## 1. Co‑morbidity between Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) / Borderline Traits

Research repeatedly finds high co-occurrence between narcissistic and borderline traits. Both disorders are classified within the DSM-5’s Cluster B personality disorders, which share features of emotional dysregulation, interpersonal instability, and antagonistic interpersonal styles. Although underlying motivations differ (BPD often linked to fear of abandonment, NPD to self-enhancement), overlap in features such as intense relationships, impulsivity, and low agreeableness contribute to diagnostic co-occurrence.

- **Epidemiological evidence**: Grant et al. (2008) using the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found significant lifetime co-occurrence between NPD and BPD, with nearly 38% of individuals with NPD also meeting criteria for BPD ([10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.06101607](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.06101607)).
- **Factor-analytic evidence**: Research indicates that narcissistic grandiosity and vulnerability are both correlated with borderline symptom severity (Miller et al., 2010) ([10.1037/a0017298](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1037/a0017298)). Narcissistic vulnerability particularly overlaps with affective instability and distrust common in BPD.

## 2. Co‑morbidity between NPD and ASPD

NPD and ASPD also show frequent co-occurrence. Both disorders share antagonism, callousness, and exploitative interpersonal behaviour, though ASPD includes a stronger behavioural emphasis on criminality and disregard for societal norms.

- **National sample evidence**: In the same NESARC dataset, NPD co-occurred with ASPD in approximately 20% of cases (Grant et al., 2008) ([10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.06101607](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.06101607)).  
- Widiger et al. (2009) argue that antagonism — especially deceitfulness, manipulativeness, and callous affect — is a shared personality dimension underlying both disorders ([10.1037/a0016601](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1037/a0016601)).
- ASPD traits can be accompanied by both narcissistic grandiosity and narcissistic vulnerability. Ronningstam & Baskin-Somers (2013) review evidence where ASPD individuals present with self-image regulation problems consistent with vulnerable narcissism ([10.1521/pedi.2013.27.5.785](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1521/pedi.2013.27.5.785)).

## 3. Co‑morbidity between ASPD and BPD / Borderline Traits

BPD and ASPD also frequently co-occur, especially in clinical and forensic settings. However, the nature of their comorbidity is complex.

- **Epidemiological evidence**: Zanarini et al. (1998) found that around 20–30% of individuals with BPD met diagnostic criteria for ASPD ([10.1177/070674379804300306](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1177/070674379804300306)).  
- **Shared features**: Both disorders involve impulsivity, aggression, and unstable relationships, but ASPD places more emphasis on chronic violations of others’ rights and lawful behaviour.
- Borderline personality organisation (as per Kernberg) encompasses potential subtypes that resemble antisocial traits, especially in “malignant borderline” presentations (Kernberg, 1984) — here, narcissistic and antisocial traits can blend with severe borderline pathology ([10.1002/1097-4679(198404)40:2<329::AID-JCLP2270400205>3.0.CO;2-6](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1002/1097-4679(198404)40:2<329::AID-JCLP2270400205>3.0.CO;2-6)).

## 4. Is the Co‑morbidity Symmetrical?

One important nuance in the research is whether the co-morbidity is bidirectional or if prevalence differs depending on the “starting” disorder.

- **BPD → NPD/ASPD**: Not all individuals with BPD have NPD or ASPD traits. For instance, Zanarini et al. (2004) found that while there is an elevated risk of ASPD in BPD populations, the majority of BPD patients do not meet ASPD diagnostic criteria ([10.1176/appi.ajp.161.12.2108](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.12.2108)).
- **NPD/ASPD → BPD**: Conversely, individuals with NPD or ASPD may often present borderline traits due to overlapping antagonism and impulsivity domains, but this is not universal. Research suggests that certain narcissistic subtypes — particularly grandiose-dominant without vulnerability — may have little to no borderline traits (Pincus & Lukowitsky, 2010) ([10.1037/a0019350](../academic-search/?type=doi&q=10.1037/a0019350)).
  
Therefore, co‑morbidity between these disorders is not strictly symmetrical. BPD is associated with increased rates of both narcissistic and antisocial traits, but the reverse is more variable, and some individuals with ASPD or pure grandiose NPD may show minimal borderline features.

## 5. Summary Table

| Pair of Disorders | Co-morbidity Tendency | Evidence Highlights |
|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| NPD ↔ BPD | Moderate to high | Overlap in vulnerability, unstable affect; Grant et al. 2008 |
| NPD ↔ ASPD | Moderate | Shared antagonism and callousness; Widiger et al. 2009 |
| BPD ↔ ASPD | Low–moderate | Not all BPD patients have ASPD; forensic overlap higher |
| Symmetry | Asymmetric | More BPD with ASPD than ASPD with BPD; narcissism-BPD link depends on subtype |

If you like, I can next create **a conceptual diagram showing the bidirectional and asymmetrical pathways** between NPD, BPD, and ASPD based on the literature review above.  
Would you like me to prepare that visual mapping?
