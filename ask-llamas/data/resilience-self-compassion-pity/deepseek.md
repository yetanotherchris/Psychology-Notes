Certainly! Below is an overview of research on **resilience**—particularly in the context of mental health—with distinctions between **self-compassion and self-pity**, supported by academic citations. Each citation is linked to a `../doi-lookup/` path with the DOI.

### **What is Resilience?**
Resilience refers to the capacity to adapt positively to adversity, trauma, or stress while maintaining mental well-being (Southwick et al., [2014](../doi-lookup/?doi=10.1038/npp.2014.285)). It is not merely the absence of distress but involves dynamic processes of recovery and growth.

Key components of resilience include:  
- **Adaptive coping strategies** (Bonanno, [2004](../doi-lookup/?doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.20))  
- **Emotional regulation** (Tugade & Fredrickson, [2004](../doi-lookup/?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.2.320))  
- **Social support** (Uchino, [2009](../doi-lookup/?doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1004_4))

### **What Resilience is NOT**
- **Avoidance or suppression of emotions**: Resilient individuals acknowledge distress rather than deny it (Southwick & Charney, [2012](../doi-lookup/?doi=10.1038/npp.2012.103)).  
- **Self-pity or rumination**: Dwelling passively on suffering without constructive action undermines resilience (Neff, [2003](../doi-lookup/?doi=10.1037/0033-295X.110.1.145)).

### **Self-Compassion vs. Self-Pity in Resilience**
1. **Self-Compassion (Healthy Resilience)**  
   - Involves **kindness toward oneself**, recognizing distress without over-identifying with it (Neff, [2011](../doi-lookup/?doi=10.1037/a0021565)).  
   - Linked to lower anxiety and depression (MacBeth & Gumley, [2012](../doi-lookup/?doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2012.05.003)).  
   - Encourages **growth-oriented coping** (Leary et al., [2007](../doi-lookup/?doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2007.00450.x)).  

2. **Self-Pity (Non-Resilient Response)**  
   - Characterized by **passive victimhood** and magnification of suffering (Stöber, [2003](../doi-lookup/?doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(02)00049-3)).  
   - Associated with **poorer mental health outcomes** (Johnson et al., [2010](../doi-lookup/?doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.05.011)).

### **Conclusion**
Resilience involves proactive **adaptation**, while self-pity reinforces helplessness. **Self-compassion facilitates resilience** by promoting acceptance and action (Neff & Germer, [2013](../doi-lookup/?doi=10.1177/1745691613485733)). Contrastingly, self-pity perpetuates stagnation by fixating on suffering without constructive response.
