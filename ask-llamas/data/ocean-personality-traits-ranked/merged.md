## Priority Ranking for Combined Work and Romantic Contexts

Research suggests different traits predict success across work and relationship domains. The following combined ranking synthesizes findings from multiple meta-analyses [1][2][3][4]:

### 1. **Conscientiousness**
- **Work rationale**: Consistently the strongest predictor of job performance across occupations (Barrick & Mount, 1991) [3]
- **Relationship rationale**: Linked to reliability, commitment, and trust - all crucial for relationship stability (Roberts & Bogg, 2004) [5]
- **Combined importance**: Essential foundation for both domains through reliability, responsibility, and goal-oriented behavior

### 2. **Emotional Stability** (Low Neuroticism)
- **Work rationale**: Predicts better stress management, decision-making, and workplace resilience (Judge et al., 1999) [3]
- **Relationship rationale**: Critical for managing relationship conflicts, reducing volatility, and providing emotional security (Karney & Bradbury, 1995) [3]
- **Combined importance**: Enables effective functioning under pressure in both domains

### 3. **Agreeableness**
- **Work rationale**: Facilitates teamwork, cooperation, and positive workplace climate (Mount et al., 1998) [5]
- **Relationship rationale**: Essential for empathy, harmony, conflict resolution, and emotional connection (Graziano & Tobin, 2009) [4]
- **Combined importance**: Creates interpersonal harmony in both contexts

### 4. **Extraversion**
- **Work rationale**: Beneficial for leadership, networking, and roles requiring social interaction (Barrick & Mount, 1991) [3]
- **Relationship rationale**: Helps with relationship initiation, social engagement, and expressing positive emotions (Watson et al., 2000) [1]
- **Combined importance**: Context-dependent; less universally critical than the above traits

### 5. **Openness to Experience**
- **Work rationale**: Valuable for creativity, innovation, and adaptability to change (George & Zhou, 2001) [3]
- **Relationship rationale**: Contributes to intellectual connection and willingness to explore new experiences together (Malouff et al., 2010) [3]
- **Combined importance**: More contextually important than universally necessary; adds richness but less foundational

## Important Considerations

- **Context matters**: The ideal trait profile depends on specific job roles and relationship dynamics
- **Balance is key**: Extreme levels of any trait can be disadvantageous
- **Trait interactions**: The combination of traits matters more than individual traits in isolation
- **Individual differences**: Personal values and preferences may shift these priorities
