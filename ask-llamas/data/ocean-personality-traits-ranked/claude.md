## Priority Ranking for Work and Romantic Relationships

Research suggests different traits may be prioritized differently depending on context (Judge et al., 1999; Malouff et al., 2010). The following rankings reflect a synthesis of findings:

### Combined Priority Ranking:

1. **Conscientiousness** - Strongly predicts both job performance (Barrick & Mount, 1991) and relationship satisfaction through reliability and commitment (Malouff et al., 2010)

2. **Agreeableness** - Critical for interpersonal harmony in both contexts; predicts team performance at work and conflict resolution in relationships (Graziano & Eisenberg, 1997; Karney & Bradbury, 1995)

3. **Emotional Stability** (low Neuroticism) - Important for stress management in work settings and emotional regulation in relationships (Judge et al., 2002; Fisher & McNulty, 2008)

4. **Extraversion** - Beneficial for leadership, networking, and social engagement in both domains, though its importance varies by specific role/relationship dynamics (Watson et al., 2000)

5. **Openness** - While valuable for innovation and creativity at work and preventing stagnation in relationships, research suggests it has the lowest overall predictive validity for combined work-relationship success (Hogan & Holland, 2003; Watson et al., 2000)

This ranking is supported by meta-analyses showing Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability as the strongest predictors of both job performance and relationship satisfaction across cultures and contexts (Barrick et al., 2001; Malouff et al., 2010).
