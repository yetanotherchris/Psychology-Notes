Below, you will find 10 main behaviourist experiments, described using academic references, including foundational classical studies as well as contemporary studies from post-1990 research, and 5 prominent behaviourist authors. Additionally, details of behavioural reinforcement types and schedules used in behaviourism research are provided.  

## Ten Influential Behaviourist Experiments:

### Classical and foundational experiments (pre-1990s):

1. **Pavlov's Classical conditioning experiments ("Pavlov's dogs"):**  
Pavlov (1927) demonstrated respondents conditioned to associate a neutral stimulus (bell sound) with an unconditioned stimulus (food), evoking a conditioned response (salivation) through simple classical conditioning mechanisms.

2. **Watson and Rayner "Little Albert" experiment:**  
Watson & Rayner (1920) demonstrated classical conditioning of emotional responses by conditioning a child, "Albert," to fear a previously neutral stimulus (white rat) through association with loud noises.  
- *Reference:* Watson, J. B., & Rayner, R. (1920). Conditioned emotional reactions. *Journal of Experimental Psychology*, 3(1), 1–14.

3. **Skinner's Operant Conditioning Box ("Skinner box") experiments:**  
B. F. Skinner (1938, 1953) illustrated operant conditioning by demonstrating how animal behaviour can be shaped by reinforcement schedules (positive/negative reinforcement), punishment, and intermittent reinforcement schedules.

4. **Thorndike's Puzzle Box experiments (Law of Effect):**  
Edward L. Thorndike (1911) described how cats learned escape behaviours by trial-and-error based on rewards, leading to his formulation of the "Law of Effect."  
- *Reference:* Thorndike, E. L. (1911). *Animal Intelligence: Experimental Studies*. New York: Macmillan.

5. **Bandura’s "Bobo Doll" Experiments (Observational learning, vicarious reinforcement):**  
While Bandura is typically considered a social learning theorist, his experiments demonstrated behavioural acquisition via observational learning using positive or negative reinforcement observed indirectly.

### Behaviourist and operant conditioning research since the 1990s:

6. **Delayed Discounting and Impulsivity Studies (Mazur 1997, 2004):**  
Mazur explored how delayed reinforcement influences impulsive decision-making using operant schedules, specifically emphasizing delay discounting (how delay impacts reinforcement value).

7. **Token Economy and Classroom Behaviour Change (Kazdin, 2001; Matson & Boisjoli, 2009):**  
These studies have used reinforcement in applied behavioural settings (educational/clinical) by employing token economies involving conditioned reinforcers to manage classroom behavior or therapeutic environments.

8. **Matching Law in Human Decision-Making (Critchfield et al., 2003):**  
Critchfield et al. applied Herrnstein’s Matching Law (reinforcement schedules) to human behaviour, demonstrating how children's choices matched the proportion and frequency of available reinforcers.  
- *Reference:* Critchfield, T. S., Paletz, E. M., MacAleese, K. R., & Newland, M. C. (2003). Punishment in human choice: Direct or competitive suppression? *Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior*, 80(1), 1–27.

9. **Behavioural Momentum Theory (Nevin & Grace, 2000; Podlesnik, Bai, & Elliffe, 2012):**  
Behavioural momentum theory explores persistence of behaviour under altered reinforcement conditions such as disruption; demonstrating how intermittent reinforcement sustains behaviour strongly despite disruptions.  
- *References:* Nevin, J. A., & Grace, R. C. (2000). Behavioral momentum and the Law of Effect. *Behavioral and Brain Sciences,* 23(1), 73–90.

10. **Contingency Management in Addiction treatments (Higgins et al., 1994; Silverman et al., 2001):**  
Contingency Management (CM) utilizes operant principles, directly providing positive and negative reinforcement schedules to discourage drug-taking behaviours. These studies indicate the efficacy of reinforcement schedules and immediate positive reinforcement.

## Types of Reinforcement and Schedules (Kazdin, 2001; Miltenberger, 2016):

### Types of reinforcement:

- **Positive reinforcement:** Presenting favourable stimuli to increase desired behaviour.
- **Negative reinforcement:** Removal/avoidance of aversive stimuli contingent upon an action, increasing the likelihood of the behaviour recurrence.
- **Punishment:** (Positive punishment) Aversive stimulus following a behaviour for suppression; (Negative punishment) Removing desirable stimuli following undesired behaviour.

### Reinforcement schedules:

- **Continuous reinforcement:** Reinforcement given after every response.
- **Intermittent (Partial) reinforcement Schedules:** Fixed ratio, Variable ratio, Fixed interval, and Variable interval—used to optimize behaviour frequency and resistance to extinction.
