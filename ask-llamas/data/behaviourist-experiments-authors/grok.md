Behaviorism is a psychological approach that emphasizes observable behaviors over internal mental states, focusing on how environmental stimuli influence responses. Below is a detailed overview of 10 main behaviorist experiments, 5 key authors, and behaviorist research since the 1990s, incorporating academic references and details on reinforcement types and schedules.

### **10 Main Behaviorist Experiments**

1. **Ivan Pavlov’s Classical Conditioning (1900s)**  
   - **Experiment**: Pavlov conducted experiments on dogs, demonstrating that a neutral stimulus (a bell) could elicit a conditioned response (salivation) when repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (food).
   - **Key Concept**: Classical conditioning, where a learned association forms between two stimuli.
   - **Type of Learning**: Associative learning without reinforcement schedules.
   - **Reference**: Pavlov, I. P. (1927). *Conditioned Reflexes: An Investigation of the Physiological Activity of the Cerebral Cortex*. Oxford University Press.

2. **John B. Watson’s Little Albert Experiment (1920)**  
   - **Experiment**: Watson and Rayner conditioned a fear response in a young child ("Little Albert") by pairing a neutral stimulus (a white rat) with a loud noise, leading to generalized fear of similar stimuli.
   - **Key Concept**: Demonstrated that emotional responses could be conditioned.
   - **Type of Learning**: Classical conditioning with negative emotional reinforcement.
   - **Reference**: Watson, J. B., & Rayner, R. (1920). Conditioned emotional reactions. *Journal of Experimental Psychology*, 3(1), 1-14.

3. **B.F. Skinner’s Operant Conditioning with Pigeons (1930s-1940s)**  
   - **Experiment**: Skinner used a "Skinner box" to study pigeons, training them to peck at a lever for food rewards, demonstrating operant conditioning.
   - **Key Concept**: Behavior is shaped by consequences (reinforcements or punishments).
   - **Type of Learning**: Positive reinforcement (food reward).
   - **Reference**: Skinner, B. F. (1938). *The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis*. Appleton-Century-Crofts.

4. **Skinner’s Schedules of Reinforcement (1950s)**  
   - **Experiment**: Skinner investigated how different schedules of reinforcement (fixed-ratio, variable-ratio, fixed-interval, variable-interval) affected behavior in rats and pigeons.
   - **Key Concept**: Variable schedules (e.g., variable-ratio as in slot machines) produce more persistent behavior than fixed schedules.
   - **Type of Learning**: Positive reinforcement with intermittent schedules.
   - **Reference**: Ferster, C. B., & Skinner, B. F. (1957). *Schedules of Reinforcement*. Appleton-Century-Crofts.

5. **Edward Thorndike’s Puzzle Box Experiment (1898)**  
   - **Experiment**: Thorndike placed cats in a puzzle box, observing that they learned to escape by trial and error, eventually associating specific actions with freedom and food.
   - **Key Concept**: Introduced the "Law of Effect"—behaviors followed by rewards are more likely to be repeated.
   - **Type of Learning**: Positive reinforcement.
   - **Reference**: Thorndike, E. L. (1911). *Animal Intelligence: Experimental Studies*. Macmillan.

6. **Clark Hull’s Drive Reduction Theory (1940s)**  
   - **Experiment**: Hull studied rats in mazes, showing that motivation (e.g., hunger) drives behavior, and satisfying a need (e.g., food) reinforces learning.
   - **Key Concept**: Behaviors are reinforced by reducing internal drives.
   - **Type of Learning**: Positive reinforcement tied to biological needs.
   - **Reference**: Hull, C. L. (1943). *Principles of Behavior: An Introduction to Behavior Theory*. Appleton-Century-Crofts.

7. **Albert Bandura’s Bobo Doll Experiment (1961)**  
   - **Experiment**: Bandura demonstrated that children imitate aggressive behaviors observed in adults, even without direct reinforcement, using a Bobo doll.
   - **Key Concept**: Social learning theory, extending behaviorism to include observational learning.
   - **Type of Learning**: Vicarious reinforcement (learning through observation).
   - **Reference**: Bandura, A., Ross, D., & Ross, S. A. (1961). Transmission of aggression through imitation of aggressive models. *Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology*, 63(3), 575-582.

8. **Skinner’s Negative Reinforcement Studies (1950s)**  
   - **Experiment**: Skinner showed that rats would press a lever to avoid an electric shock, demonstrating that behavior can be shaped by the removal of an aversive stimulus.
   - **Key Concept**: Negative reinforcement strengthens behavior by removing a negative stimulus.
   - **Type of Learning**: Negative reinforcement.
   - **Reference**: Skinner, B. F. (1953). *Science and Human Behavior*. Macmillan.

9. **Joseph Wolpe’s Systematic Desensitization (1950s)**  
   - **Experiment**: Wolpe developed a technique to treat phobias by pairing relaxation with gradual exposure to feared stimuli, countering conditioned fear responses.
   - **Key Concept**: Reciprocal inhibition—positive responses can extinguish negative conditioned responses.
   - **Type of Learning**: Classical conditioning with positive reinforcement (relaxation).
   - **Reference**: Wolpe, J. (1958). *Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition*. Stanford University Press.

10. **Garcia and Koelling’s Taste Aversion Studies (1966)**  
    - **Experiment**: John Garcia showed that rats quickly learn to avoid certain tastes associated with illness, even with long delays between stimulus and consequence.
    - **Key Concept**: Biological preparedness in learning; not all stimuli are equally conditionable.
    - **Type of Learning**: Classical conditioning with negative reinforcement (avoidance of illness).
    - **Reference**: Garcia, J., & Koelling, R. A. (1966). Relation of cue to consequence in avoidance learning. *Psychonomic Science*, 4(1), 123-124.

### **Behaviorist Research Since the 1990s**

Since the 1990s, behaviorism has evolved into applied behavior analysis (ABA) and integrated with cognitive and neuroscientific approaches. Key areas include autism treatment, education, and behavioral economics.

1. **Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) in Autism (1990s-Present)**  
   - Research by Lovaas and others since the 1990s has shown that intensive behavioral interventions using positive reinforcement can improve communication and social skills in children with autism.
   - **Type of Learning**: Positive reinforcement (rewards for desired behaviors); often uses fixed-ratio schedules for skill acquisition.

### **Details on Types of Reinforcement and Schedules**

- **Positive Reinforcement**: Adding a desirable stimulus to increase behavior (e.g., food reward in Skinner’s experiments).  
- **Negative Reinforcement**: Removing an aversive stimulus to increase behavior (e.g., turning off a shock in Skinner’s studies).  
- **Positive Punishment**: Adding an aversive stimulus to decrease behavior (e.g., a reprimand).  
- **Negative Punishment**: Removing a desirable stimulus to decrease behavior (e.g., taking away privileges).  
- **Schedules of Reinforcement** (Skinner, 1957):  
  - **Fixed-Ratio (FR)**: Reinforcement after a set number of responses (e.g., a reward after every 5 lever presses). Produces high response rates with pauses after rewards.  
  - **Variable-Ratio (VR)**: Reinforcement after an unpredictable number of responses (e.g., slot machines). Produces high, steady response rates.  
  - **Fixed-Interval (FI)**: Reinforcement after a set time interval (e.g., a reward every 10 minutes). Leads to scalloped response patterns (low activity initially, then a surge near reward time).  
  - **Variable-Interval (VI)**: Reinforcement after an unpredictable time interval (e.g., checking email for a reply). Produces moderate, steady response rates.  
- **Intermittent Reinforcement**: Reinforcement delivered irregularly (includes VR and VI schedules), leading to more persistent behavior compared to continuous reinforcement due to the unpredictability of reward.

### **Conclusion**
Behaviorist experiments and theories have significantly shaped psychology, from Pavlov’s foundational work to modern applications in ABA and behavioral economics. Since the 1990s, behaviorism has adapted to new fields, maintaining its focus on observable behavior while integrating multidisciplinary insights. Reinforcement types and schedules remain central to understanding how behaviors are learned and maintained, as evidenced by both historical and contemporary research.
