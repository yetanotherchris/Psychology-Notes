Averages Central values of data. e.g. mean, median, mode - measures of central tendency Between participants Dividing participants into groups for each condition of the experiment. e.g. Group A receives a drug, Group B receives a placebo. Bimodal If there are two modes, and they're clearly higher (peeks) than other values. Unimodal (1 mode) and multimodal (multiple modes) Categorical &amp; ranking data Non-numeric data grouped by category or order. e.g. blood type (categorical), race position (ranking). Confounding variables Uncontrolled variables that affect the outcome. e.g. diet affecting weight loss in an exercise study. Correlational co-efficient Strength and direction of variable relationship. e.g. Pearson's r = 0.85 indicates strong positive correlation.  week13 Dependent variable The measured outcome, e.g. heart rate change Descriptive statistics Descriptions of the data from the sample. e.g. a graph or table of data, mean or median. Distribution How data values are spread. e.g. normal, skewed, or bimodal. Experimental design A research design involving manipulation of an independent variable. e.g. testing whether caffeine improves memory by assigning participants to caffeine or no caffeine groups. Falsification Concept that a hypothesis must be disprovable. e.g. 'All swans are white' can be falsified by finding one black swan. Frequency distribution Counts of values in intervals. e.g. histogram of age groups. Generalizing Generalising from the sample to the population Global Samples Diverse samples from various locations. e.g. participants from multiple countries. Graph types Scatter plot, histogram, bar chart. Hypothesis testing Statistical procedure to determine support for a hypothesis. e.g. testing if a new drug reduces symptoms more than a placebo. Hypothesis: one tailed A hypothesis that predicts the direction of the two variables, e.g. extra cheese leads to worst sleep Hypothesis: two tailed A hypothesis that is neutral about the direction or relationship of the two variables Independent Variable The manipulated variable. e.g. film category watched Inferential statistics Statistical tools that allow researchers to their sample to the population. Line of best fit Line approximating data trend in a scatterplot. e.g. average trend in exam scores vs. study time. Mean Sum of values divided by number. e.g. average test score. Median Middle value in an ordered dataset. e.g. the 5th value in a list of 9 scores. Measures of central tendency Mode, median, mean Mode The most common result, e.g. scores 1,3, 5, 6, 6, 7 it would be 6. There would be no mode if they're all unique. NHST TODO Normal distribution The mean, median, and mode are equal. The data is symmetric (bell curve). The data tapers off gradually. AKA Gaussian distribution P-Value Probability between 0 and 1 Qualitative data Descriptive data. e.g. interviews. Quantitative data Numerical data. e.g. height, temperature. Quasi experimental An experimental design without random assignment. e.g. comparing student performance across two existing classes. Range Difference between highest and lowest values. e.g. if scores range from 60 to 90, the range is 30. Sample Selecting a subset of a population. e.g. choosing 100 students from a university. Sampling variation Each time you choose 10 subjects for your sample, you might get variation in the mean of the value you want to measure, e.g. height. It might also be different from the population. Sample size is important, and inferential statistics are used to generalise to the population. Sampling error Error from using a sample instead of the full population. e.g. survey results differ from actual population values. Sampling error: Type 1 Rejecting a true null hypothesis. e.g. concluding a drug works when it doesn't. Sampling error: Type 2 Failing to reject a false null hypothesis. e.g. missing the effect of a useful drug. Scale Measurement system classifying data. e.g. nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio scales. Scatterplot Graph showing a two variable relationship. e.g. height vs. weight. Standard deviation Spread of data around the mean. e.g. SD = 2 means most scores lie within 2 points of the mean. Statistical significance In psychology, statistical significance occurs when the p-value, calculated from a test like chi-squared, is less than 0.05 (5%). This means there's less than a 5% chance the results are due to random variation if the null hypothesis is true, so we reject it for the alternative hypothesis.

So needing someone to act this neurosis out with, and they are used by the ego as a defense.</p> <p>The Sander chapter ends by describing two case studies, and talks about therapists in the 1930s and 1940s noticing that couples' marriage health got worst when they were both in therapy - transferrence was occurring onto both the spouse and the therapist. More recently, the book continues, family therapists have described \"shared externalization of internal conflicts\". </p> <p>...\"we are noting explicitly what earlier authors from Freud on[wards] implicitly noted: the shared participation in neurotic conflicts. The threats of object loss, loss of love, castration, and superego disapproval - the calamities of childhood in all ages and cultures -- continue to affect our relations to others, especially with whom we live and work\".</p> <p>And then the book goes to describe how this plays out as repetition compulsion in marriages:</p> <p>\"The repression of such universal childhood experiences and conflicts leads to their repetition with important others who reciprocally enact similar or complementary unconscious conflicts.\"</p> <p>Sam Vaknin describes one form of a repetition compulsion he believes narcisists play out in their relationships - the compulsion to (internally) discard, de-value, and then leave the partner (or their partner leaves them as they don't like this) which Sam Vaknin calls \"separation individuation\" (from Jung). The sad (??) part is the narcisist will never individuate as they needed to, as their partner acting as their mother is symbolic - the introject of their bad mother will live on.</p> <p>This is Vaknin's theory about what drives a narcissist in a relationship, the need to right the wrongs of the past. You both enter into a shared fantasy at the beginning of the relationship, in which the Narcisist takes on characteristics of your mother/father, and this is reciprocated with you taking on their mother/father. The narcissist has had trauma early on in life, and possibly later in the formative years via another care giver, and so will have \"catastrophic anxieties\".</p> <p>At the end of the chapter, Sander describes how there is hope in modern times, that if the neuroses are brought into pyschoanalysis, patients can become aware of their defense mechanisms. Unfortunately for Narcissists, as Vaknin describes in many of his videos, their alloplastic defenses (for example blaming others, projection) would make the pyschoanalysis unlikely to happen, or it being abandoned within months.</p>"},{"location":"Cluster-B/vaknin-narcissism-notes/","title":"Notes from Sam Vaknin on Narcissism","text":"<p>(From 2023 - https://www.youtube.com/@samvaknin)</p>"},{"location":"Cluster-B/vaknin-narcissism-notes/#basic-test-for-narcissism-pathological-or-traits-of","title":"Basic test for Narcissism (pathological or traits of)","text":"<p>Does the person exhibit the following?</p> <p>Remorse A normal person will show a modocom of embarrassment and repeatedly and publically show remorse.
