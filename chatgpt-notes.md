### Chat GPT Notes
I've used ChatGPT 4o to create summaries in a lot of the definitions, after reading and watching videos on the topics. I then added or amended to the definitions where needed. I had some rough notes to start with so I had an idea if what Chat GPT was telling me was garbage or not - for example it got the Hare PCL-R test (I mispelled "Harre") radically wrong.

I asked ChatGPT where it gets its sources from, this was its answer:

> The information provided in the summaries comes from a broad understanding of well-established psychological theories and concepts. While I didn't reference specific books or websites directly in the moment of crafting the summaries, I can point out the types of sources typically used to inform such explanations:

> 1. **Textbooks and Academic Books**: 
>    - *"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)"* by the American Psychiatric Association for information on pathology.
>    - *"Beyond the Pleasure Principle"* by Sigmund Freud for the Pleasure Principle.
>    - *"Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory"* by Albert Bandura for Relational Schema.
>    - *"The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations"* by Fritz Heider for attribution theory (dispositional and null attribution).
>    - *"Cognitive Therapy of Personality Disorders"* by Aaron T. Beck for relational schema psychology.
>    - *"The Developing Mind"* by Daniel J. Siegel for windows of vulnerability and mental health.

> 2. **Academic Journals**:
>    - Articles on developmental psychology and psychopathology for the window of vulnerability.
>    - Journals like *Journal of Social Psychology* and *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology* for the Just World Phenomenon.

> 3. **Psychoanalytic and Psychodynamic Theory**:
>    - *"The Essential Writings of Donald Winnicott"* for soothing mirroring.
>    - *"Attachment and Loss"* by John Bowlby for mature dependence.

> 4. **Websites**:
>    - Websites such as the *American Psychological Association (APA)* and *Psychology Today* are also commonly referenced for concise definitions and explanations of these concepts.
>    - *Simply Psychology* and *Verywell Mind* for accessible explanations of psychological terms and theories.

> Since these explanations were synthesized from general knowledge rather than drawn from specific articles or texts in real-time, they reflect a broad academic background rather than a single source. For precise citations or direct quotes, consulting the aforementioned textbooks and peer-reviewed articles would be the most reliable approach.

**Are you trained using books such as Freud's books?**

> Yes, my training includes exposure to a vast range of texts, theories, and concepts from various domains, including psychology. This encompasses foundational works by key figures like Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, B.F. Skinner, Jean Piaget, Erik Erikson, and many others. Specifically, works by Freud, such as "The Interpretation of Dreams," "Beyond the Pleasure Principle," and other core psychoanalytic texts, are part of the broader knowledge base I've been trained on.

> In addition to classical texts, my training includes content from modern psychology, neuroscience, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and other contemporary psychological approaches. This allows me to provide information that is grounded in both historical and current perspectives in psychology.

> However, it's important to note that I do not have direct access to copyrighted texts or proprietary content. My responses are generated based on patterns learned from the data I was trained on, which includes publicly available information, educational resources, and general knowledge across a wide array of subjects.
